Trump, the 45th President of the United States.   The report is the culmination of an investigation that began in September 2019 and misconduct towards Ukraine emerged.  The Committees pursued the truth vigorously, but fairly, ensuring the full participation of both parties throughout the probe.    Sustained by the tireless work of more than three dozen dedicated staff across the three Committees, we issued dozens of subpoenas for documents and testimony and took more than 100 hours of deposition testimony from 17 witnesses.  To provide the American people the opportunity to learn and evaluate the facts themselves, the Intelligence Committee held seven public hearings with 12 witnessesincluding three requested by the Republican Minoritythat totaled more than 30 hours.   At the outset, I want to recognize my late friend and colleague Elijah E. Cummings, whose grace and commitment to justice served as our North Star throughout this investigation.  I would also like to thank my colleagues Eliot L. Engel and Carolyn B. Maloney, chairs respectively of the Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees, as well as the Members of those Committees, many of whom provided invaluable contributions.  Members of the Intelligence Committee, as well, worked selflessly and collaboratively throughout this investigation.  Finally, I am grateful to Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the trust she placed in our Committees to conduct this work and for her wise counsel throughout.  I also want to thank the dedicated professional staff of the Intelligence Committee, who worked ceaselessly and with remarkable poise and ability.  My deepest gratitude goes to Daniel Goldman, Rheanne Wirkkala, Maher Bitar, Timothy Bergreen, Patrick Boland, Daniel Noble, Nicolas Mitchell, Sean Misko, Patrick Fallon, Diana Pilipenko, William Evans, Ariana Rowberry, Wells Bennett, and William Wu.  Additional Intelligence Committee staff members also assured that the important oversight work of the Committee continued, even as we were required to take on the additional responsibility of conducting a key part of the House impeachment inquiry.  Finally, I would like to thank the devoted and outstanding staff of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, including but not limited to Dave Rapallo, Susanne Sachsman Grooms, Peter Kenny, Krista Boyd, and Janet Kim, as well as Laura Carey from the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  * * *  In his farewell address, President George Washington warned of a moment when , and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines8  The Framers of the Constitution well understood that an individual could one day occupy the Office of the President who would place his personal or political interests above those of the nation.  Having just won hard-fought independence from a King with unbridled authority, they were attuned to the dangers of an executive who lacked fealty to the law and the Constitution.   In response, the Framers adopted a tool used by the British Parliament for several hundred years to constrain the Crownthe power of impeachment.  Unlike in Britain, where impeachment was typically reserved for inferior officers but not the King himself, impeachment in our untested democracy was specifically intended to serve as the ultimate form of accountability for a duly-elected President.  Rather than a mechanism to overturn an election, impeachment was explicitly contemplated as a remedy of last resort for a president who fails to   Accordingly, the Constitution confers the power to impeach the president on Congress, stating that t While the Constitutional standard for removal from office is justly a high one, it is nonetheless an essential check and balance on the authority of the occupant of the Office of the President, particularly when that occupant represents a continuing threat to our fundamental democratic norms, values, and laws.

In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into  domestic political opponent.  In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.9  The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential upcoming presidential election to his advantage.  In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.  At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President , 2019, , which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure.  The call record alone is stark evidence of his personal political benefit over the assistance, which President Trump  two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.  Our investigation determined that this telephone call was neither the start nor the end of Rather, it was a dramatic crescendo within a months-long campaign driven by President Trump in which senior U.S. officials, including the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Acting Chief of Staff, the Secretary of Energy, and others were either knowledgeable of or active participants in an effort to extract from a foreign nation the personal political benefits sought by the President.   , notwithstanding an unprecedented campaign of obstruction by the President and his Administration to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony.  , defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify.  The White House, Department of State, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Energy refused to produce a single document in response to our subpoenas.    Ultimately, this sweeping effort to stonewall the House of Representativesand testified in response to lawful process.  The report that follows was only possible because of their sense of duty and devotion to their country and its Constitution.   Nevertheless, there remain unanswered questions, and our investigation must continue, even as we transmit our report to the Judiciary Committee.  Given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress.  Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the President since the inquiry began.   The damage the President has done to our relationship with a key strategic partner will be remedied over time, and Ukraine continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support in Congress.  But the damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three10  branches of government, will be long-to stonewall Congress goes unchecked.  Any future President will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance, or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three.  * * *  The decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry is not one we took lightly.  Under the best of circumstances, impeachment is a wrenching process for the nation.  I resisted calls to undertake an impeachment investigation for many months on that basis, notwithstanding the existence of presidential misconduct that I believed to be deeply unethical and damaging to our democracy.  The alarming events and actions detailed in this report, however, left us with no choice but to proceed.  misconduct was not an isolated occurrence, nor was it the product of a na√Øve president.  Instead, the efforts to involve Ukraine in our 2020 presidential election were undertaken by a President who himself was elected in 2016 with the benefit of an unprecedented and sweeping campaign of election interference undertaken by Russia in his favor, and which the President welcomed and utilized.    Having witnessed the degree to which interference by a foreign power in 2016 harmed our democracy, President Trump cannot credibly claim ignorance to its pernicious effects.  Even  Ukrainian President Zelensky, in which he solicited an investigation to damage his most feared 2020 opponent, came the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress opponent and his urgent warning of the dangers of further foreign interference in the next election. With this backdrop, the solicitation of new foreign intervention was the act of a president unbound, not one chastened by experience.  It was the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection.   This repeated and pervasive threat to our democratic electoral process added urgency to our work.  On October 3, 2019, even as our Committee was engaged in this inquiry, President Trump publicly declared anew that other countries should open investigations into his chief Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that thWhen a reporter asked the President what he July 25 call, President Trump, seeking to dispel any doubt as to his continuing intention, responded:  investigation into the Bidens.

There will always be some variation in the testimony of multiple people witnessing the same events, but few of the differences here go to the heart of the matter.  And so, it may have been all the more surprising to the public to see very disparate reactions to the testimony by the Members of Congress from each party.    If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism.

How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences?             America remains the beacon of democracy and opportunity for freedom-loving people around the world.

Schiff Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence12  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.  As described in this executive summary and the report that Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.  The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election.  To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations:  a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.  During a July 25, 2019, call between President Trump and President Zelensky, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for U.S. military assistance.  President Trump immediately Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory.  In turn, President Zelensky assured President Trump that he would pursue the investigation and intentionally bypassed many career personnel, it was undertaken with the knowledge and Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  In fact, at a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine   President Trump and his senior officials may see nothing wrong with using the power of campaign.  Indeed, President Trump continues to encourage Ukraine and other foreign countries to engage in the same kind of election interference today.  However, the Founding Fathers prescribed a remedy for a chief executive who places his personal interests above those of the country:  impeachment.  Accordingly, as part of the House of Representatiinquiry, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in coordination with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, were compelled to undertake a serious, sober, and expeditious investigation into whether the Presiden  In response, President Trump engaged in an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of this impeachment inquiry.  Nevertheless, due in large measure to patriotic and courageous public servants who provided the Committees Committees uncovered significant misconduct on the part of the President of the United States.  As required under House Resolution 660, the Intelligence Committee, in consultation with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, has prepared this report to detail the evidence uncovered to date, which will now be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee for its consideration.13  SECTION I  The President Conditioned a White House Meeting and Military Aid to Ukraine on a Public Announcement of Investigations Beneficial to his Reelection Campaign    On the morning of July 25, 2019, President Donald Trump settled in to the White House Executive Residence to join a telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.  It had been more than three months since President Zelensky, a political neophyte, had been swept into office in a landslide victory on a platform of rooting out corruption and ending the war between his country and Russia.  The day of his election, April 21, President Zelensky spoke briefly with President Trump, who had called to congratulate him and invite him to a visit at the White House.  As of July 25, no White House meeting had materialized.   As is typical for telephone calls with other heads of state, staff members from the National Security Council (NSC) convened in the White House Situation Room to listen to the call and take notes, which would later be compiled into a memorandum that would constitute the U.S. gtalking points for the President based on official U.S. policy.  The talking points included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine, a pillar of American foreign policy in the country as far back as its independence in the 1990s when Ukraine first rid itself of Kremlin control.    This call would deviate significantly from that script.  Shortly before he was patched through to President Zelensky, President Trump spoke with Gordon Sondland, who had donated had appointed as the United States Ambassador to the European Union.  Ambassador Sondland had helped lay the groundwork for a very different kind of call between the two Presidents.  Ambassador Sondland had relayed a message to President Zelensky six days earlier that in his call with President Trump.  Ambassador Sondland understood these phrases to refer to two investigations politically beneficial to the Presi one into former Vice President Joe Biden and a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma, on which his son sat on the board, and the other into a discredited conspiracy theory alleging that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  The allegations about Vice President Biden were without evidence, and the U.S. Intelligence Community had unanimously determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election to help the candidacy of Donald Trump.  Despite the falsehoods, Ambassador Sondland would make it clear to Ukrainian officials that the public announcement of these investigations was a prerequisite for the coveted White House meeting with President Trump, an effort that on campaign.  The White House meeting was not the only official act that President Trump conditioned on the announcement of these investigations.  Several weeks before his phone call with President Zelensky, President Trump ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of congressionally-14  appropriated security assistance to Ukraine that provided Kyiv essential support as it sought to repel Russian forces that were occupying Crimea and inflicting casualties in the eastern region of ion to freeze the aid, made without explanation, sent shock waves through the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State, and the NSC, which uniformly supported providing this assistance to our strategic partner.  Although the suspension of aid had not been made public by the day of the call between the two Presidents, officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington had already asked American officials about the status of the vital military assistance.   At the outset of the conversation on July 25, President Zelensky thanked President Trump indicated that Ukraine would soon be prepared to purchase additional Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States as part of this defense cooperation.  President Trump immediately responded with his own request:    President and numerous European partners to be corrupt.  In so doing, President Trump gave currency to a baseless allegation that Vice President Biden wanted to remove the corrupt prosecutor because he was investigating Burisma, a company on time.     Over the course of the roughly thirty-minute call, President Trump repeated these false allegations and pressed the Ukrainian President to consult with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who had been publicly advocating for months for Ukraine to initiate these specific investigations.  President Zelensky phis invitation to join him at the White that Ukr  During the call, President Trump also disparaged Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who championed anti-corruption reforms in the country, and whom President Trump had unceremoniously removed months earlier following a smear campaign  who was widely viewed as corrupt and who helped initiate the smear campaign against her, calling   Hearing the call as it transpired, several White House staff members became alarmed.  -throated enhoped for, the President instead demanded a political investigation into an Americanthe presidential candidate he evidently feared most, Joe Biden.    Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an NSC staff member responsible for Ukraine policy who listened to the call, immediately reported his concerns to NSC lawyers.  His15  supervisor, NSC Senior Director for Europe and Russia Timothy Morrison, also reported the call to the lawyers, worrying that the call wolawyers placed the memorandum summarizing the call onto a highly classified server, significantly limiting access to the materials.      The call record would not remain hidden forever.  On September 25, 2019, facing immense public pressure to reveal the contents of the call and following the announcement the previous day of a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives into President cly released the memorandum of the July 25 call.    The record of the call would help explain for those involved in Ukraine policy in the U.S. government, the Congress, and the public why President Trump, his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, his hand-picked appointees in charge of Ukraine issues, and various senior Administration officials would go to great lengths to withhold a coveted White House meeting and critical military aid from Ukraine at a time when it served as a bulwark against Russian aggression in Europe.    The answer was as simple as it was inimical to our national security and election integrity:  the President was withholding officials acts while soliciting something of value to his reelection campaignan investigation into his political rival.  The story of that scheme follows.  * * *  The President Removed Anti-Corruption Champion Ambassador Yovanovitch  On April 24, 2019, President Donald Trump abruptly called back to Washington the campaign was waged against her.  She was known throughout Ukraine and among her peers for aggressively advocating for anti-corruption reforms consistent with U.S. foreign policy and only recently had been asked to extend her stay in Ukraine.  Her effectiveness in anti-corruption efforts earned her enemies in Kyiv and in Washington.  As Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified in praising Ambassador Yovanovitch:    Beginning on March 20, The Hill newspaper published several op-eds attacking Ambassador Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden, relying on information from a Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was widely viewed to be corrupt.  Mr. Lutsenko had served as the chief prosecutor in Ukraine under the then-incumbent president who lost to Volodymyr Zelensky in April 2019.  Although he would later recant many of his allegations, Mr. Lutsenko falsely accused Ambassador Yovanovitch of speaking negatively about President Trump and giving Mr. Lutsenko -not-pr16  The attacks against Ambassador Yovanovitch were amplified by prominent, close allies of President Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and his associates, Sean Hannity, and Donald Trump Jr.  President Trump tweeted the smears himself just a month before he recalled the Ambassador Ambassador Yovanovitch and other senior State Department officials asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement of support for her and for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.  The Secretary declined, fearing that President Trump might publicly undermine those efforts, possibly through a tweet.  Following a ceremony in which she presented an award of courage to the family of a young female anti-corruption activist killed in Ukraine for her work, Ambassador Yovanovitch take the first plane back to Washington.  When she arrived, she was informed that she had done nothing wrong, but that the President had lost confidence in her.  She was told to leave her post as soon as possible.  In her place, the President would designate three new agents to spearhead Ukraine policy, political appointees an ambassador known for her efforts to fight corruption.  -Picked Agents Began the Scheme  hington, President Trump had his first telephone call with President-elect Zelensky.

Although the White House public summary of the call included some discussion of a commitment President Trump did not mention corruption at all.

Col. Vindman also attended.  In comments that would foreshadow troubling events to come, Lt. Col. Vindman warned President Zelensky to stay out of U.S. domestic politics to avoid jeopardizing the bipartisan support Ukraine enjoyed in Congress.  The delegation returned to the United States impressed with President Zelensky, especially his focus on anti-corruption reforms.  Ambassador Sondland quickly organized a meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 23, attended by most of the other members of the delegation.  The three political appointees, who would describe themselves as and encouraged him to schedule the Oval Office meeting he promised in his April 21 phone call with the new leader.    if they hoped to advance relations with Ukraine.  President Trump directed the three senior U.S. government officials to   portfolio, Bill Taylor, a former Ambassador to Ukraine, was considering whether to come out of retirement to accept a request to succeed Ambassador Yovanovitch in Kyiv.  As of May 26,  to succeed with the Giuliani-Secretary Pompeo that U.S. policy toward Ukraine would not change, Ambassador Taylor accepted the position and arrived in Kyiv on June 17.  Ambassador Taylor would quickly come official channel of diplomatic relations with Ukraine.  Mr. Giuliani would prove to be, as the National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton would tell a colleague, a grenade that was going to blow everyone up.  The President Froze Vital Military Assistance  For fiscal year 2019, Congress appropriated and authorized $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine:  $250 million in funds administered by DOD and $141 million in funds administered by the State Department.  On June 18, DOD issued a press release announcing its intention to provide $250 million in taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine following the18  certification that all legitimate conditions on the aid, including anti-corruption reforms, had been met.  Shortly after this announcement, however, both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and DOD received inquiries from the President related to the funds.  At that time, and throughout the next few months, support for Ukraine security assistance was overwhelming and unanimous among all of the relevant agencies and within Congress.  By July 3, OMB blocked a Congressional notification which would have cleared the way for the release of $141 million in State Department security assistance funds.  By July 12, President Trump had placed a hold on all military support funding for Ukraine.  On July 18, OMB announced the hold to all of the relevant agencies and indicated that it was directed by the President.  No other reason was provided.    During a series of policy meetings involving increasingly senior officials, the uniform and consistent position of all policymaking agencies supported the release of funding.  Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the NSC argued that it was in the national security United States aids Ukraine and her people so that they can f  direction to withhold assistance to Ukraine that Congress had already appropriated for this express purpose.

Nevertheless, President Trump continued to withhold the funding to Ukraine without explanation, against the interests of U.S. national security, and over the objections of these career experts.      The President Conditioned a White House Meeting on Investigations            By the time Ukrainian officials were first learning about an issue with the anticipated -picked representatives to Ukraine had already informed their Uhappen after Ukraine committed to pursuing the two political investigations that President Trump and Mr. Giuliani demanded.    know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question:  Was there a quid pro quo?  As I testified previously with regard to the Sondland and Volker worked to obtain the necessary assurance from President Zelensky that he would personally commit to initiate the investigations in order to secure both.19  On July 2, in Toronto, Canada, Ambassador Volker conveyed the message directly to engagement with the United States.  For his part, Mr. Giuliani made clear to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, who were directly communicating with the Ukrainians, that a White House meeting would not occur until Ukraine announced its pursuit of the two political investigationsn the ouster of a U.S. Ambassador and many things is Rudi [sic]  On July 10, Ambassador Bolton hosted a meeting in the White House with two senior Ukrainian officials, several American officials, including Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, Secretary Perry, Dr. Fiona Hill, Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the NSC, and Lt. Col. Vindman.  As had become customary each time Ukrainian officials met with their American counterparts, the Ukrainians asked about the long-delayed White House meeting.  Ambassador Bolton demurred, but Ambassador Sondland spoke up, revealing that he had worked out an arrangement with Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to schedule the White House visit after meeting.    Undaunted, Ambassador Sondland ushered many of the attendees to the Ward Room downstairs to continue their discussion.  In the second meeting, Ambassador Sondland explained that he had an agreement with Mr. Mulvaney that the White House visit would come only after Ukraine announced the Burisma/Biden and 2016 Ukraine election interference investigations.  At this second meetinwould have to go through proper channels.    Following these discussions, Dr. Hill reported back to Ambassador Bolton, who told her to go and tell [the NSC Legal Advisor] that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on thisincident to the NSC Legal Advisor.      Over the next two weeks, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked closely with Mr. Giuliani and senior Ukrainian and American officials to arrange a telephone call between President Trump and President Zelensky and to ensure that the Ukrainian President explicitly promised to undertake the political investigations required by President Trump to schedule the White House meeting.  As Ambassador Sondland would later testify:  expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew these investigations   On July 19, Ambassador Volker had breakfast with Mr. Giuliani and his associate, Lev Parnas, at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Mr. Parnas would subsequently be indicted for campaign finance violations as part of an investigation that remains ongoing.  During the conversation, Ambassador Volker stressed his belief that the attacks being leveled publicly20  against Vice President Biden related to Ukraine were false and that the former Vice President -serving narrative to preserve himself in benefit of President Trump did not cease.  Ambassador Volker also offered to help arrange an in-person meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Andriy Yermak, one of Presitrusted advisors, which would later take place in Madrid, Spain in early August.    After the breakfast meeting at the Trump Hotel, Ambassador Volker reported back to Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor about his conversation with Mr. Giuliani, writing in a text and address any specific personnel issues to remove Mr. Lutsenko as prosecutor general, a decision with which Mr. Giuliani disagreed.  The same day, Ambassador Sondland spoke with President Zelensky and recommended that the political investigations during the upcoming presidential phone call.    Ambassador Sondland emailed several top Administration officials, including Secretary of State Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Secretary Perry, stating that President he was referring in the email to the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election interference investigations. Secretary Perry and Mr. Mulvaney responded affirmatively that the call would soon take place, the White House meeting on the announcement of political investigations beneficial to President Trump.  The arrangement troubled the Ukrainian P  The President Pressed President Zelensky to Do a Political Favor  On the morning of July 25, Ambassador Volker sent a text message to President  assuming President Z conv  President Zelensky followed this advice during his conversation with President Trump.  President Zelensky assured that he would pursue the investigations that President Trump had discussedinto the Bidens and 2016 election interferenceand, in turn, pressed for the White House meeting that remained outstanding.    The following day, Ambassadors Volker, Sondland, and Taylor met with President Zelensky in Kyiv.  The Ukrainian President told them that President Trump had mentioned one call.  Following the meeting with the Ukrainian leader, Ambassador Sondland had a private, one-on-one conversation with Mr.21  outdoor restaurant terrace with State Department aides where he called President Trump directly from his cellphone.  The White House confirmed that the conversation lasted five minutes.    At the outset of the call, President Trump asked Ambassador Sondland whether President President Trump had raised with President Zelensky the day before.  Ambassador Sondland stated that President Zelensky  phone, Ambassador Sondland and President Trump spoke only about the investigation in their discussion about Ukraine.  The President made no mention of other major issues of importance in Ukraine, including  aggressive anti-corruption reforms and the ongoing war it was fighting against Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine.  After hanging up the phone, Ambassador Sondland explained to Mr. Holmes that he Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was Ambassador Sondland did not recall referencing Biden specifically, but he did not dispute Mr. discussion with Mr. Holmes.   President  -picked representatives in person, over the phone, and by text messageto secure a public announcement of the investigations   In discussions with Ukrainian officials, Ambassador Sondland understood that President Trump did not require that Ukraine conduct investigations as a prerequisite for the White House meeting so much as publicly announce the investigationsmaking clear that the goal was not the investigations, but the political benefit Trump would derive from their announcement and the cloud they might put over a political opponent.    Giuliani in person.  There, they agreed that Ukraine would issue a public statement, and they discussed potential dates for a White House meeting.  A few days later, Ambassador Volker told President Trump, White House visit by President Zelensky.  On August 9, Ambassador Volker and Mr. Giuliani spoke twice by phone, and Ambassador Sondland spoke twice to the White House for a total of about 20 minutes.  In a text was the public22  statement announcing the two political investigations sought by President Trump and Mr. Giuliani.  The following day, Ambassador Sondland briefed State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, a top advisor to Secretary Pompeo, on these discussions about President Zelensky issuing a statement that would include an announcement of the two political investigations.  Ambassador Sondland also emailed Secretary executive secretary and Mr. Brechbuhl, to inform them about the agreement for President Zelensky to give the press conference.  He expected to see a draft of the statement, which would   On August 12, Mr. Yermak sent the proposed statement to Ambassador Volker, but it lacked specific references reelection campaign.  The following morning, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker spoke with references and returned it to the Ukrainian President aide.    Mr. Yermak balked at getting drawn into U.S. politics and asked Ambassador Volker whether the United States had inquired about investigations through any appropriate Department of Justice channels.  The answer was no, and several witnesses testified that a request to a United States sought to promote in eastern Europe, specifically the rule of law.  Ambassador Volker eventually agreed with Mr. Yermak that the announcement of the Biden/Burisma and statement was temporaril  Nevertheless, Ambassador Sondland, in accontinued to pursue the statement into early September 2019.    Once President Trump placed security assistance on hold On July 25, DOD officials learned that diplomats at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington had made multiple overtures to DOD and the State   Separately, two different contacts at the , Catherine Croft, to ask her in confidence about the hold.  Ms. Croft was surprised at the effectiveness of their withholding critical military aid to Ukraine.  By mid-August, before the freeze on aid became public, Lt. Col. Vindman had also received inquiries from an official at the Ukrainian Embassy.    The hold remained in place throughout August against the unanimous judgment of American officials focused on Ukraine policy.  Without an explanation for the hold, which ran contrary to the recommendation of all relevant agencies, and with President Trump already23  conditioning a White House visit on the announcement of the political investigations, it became increasingly apparent to multiple witnesses that the military aid was also being withheld in exchange for the announcement of those.  As both Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Holmes would later testify   On August 22, Ambassador Sondland emailed Secretary Pompeo again, recommending a plan for a potential meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland ith confidence on those issues of   Ambassador Sondland testified that this was a reference to the political investigations that President Trump discussed on the July 25 call, that Secretary Pompeo had listened to.  Ambassathe hold on critical security assistance to Ukraine.  Secretary Pompeo replied three minutes later:      On August 28, Politico published a story -long hold on U.S. military assistance to Ukraine.  Senior Ukrainian officials expressed grave concern, deeply worried about the practical impact on their efforts to fight Russian aggression, but also about the public message it sent to the Russian government, which would almost certainly seek to exploit any real or perceived crack in U.S. resolve toward Ukraine.       On August 29, at the urging of National Security Advisor Bolton, Ambassador Taylor wrote a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo.  This was the only first-person cable the withholding security assistance to Ukraine as it fought a hot war against Russia on its borders.  stated that Secretary Pompeo may have carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House.    The same day that Ambassador Taylor sent his cable, President Trump cancelled his planned trip to Warsaw for a World War II commemoration event, where he was scheduled to meet with President Zelensky.  Vice President Pence traveled in his place.  Ambassador Sondland also traveled to Warsaw and, at a pre-briefing discussion with the Vice President before he met President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland raised the issue of the hold on security become tied to the issue of investigationsurprise nor dismay at the linkage between the two.   At the meeting, President Zelensky expressed concern that even an appearance of wavering support from the United States for Ukraine could embolden Russia.  Vice President Pence reiterated U.S. support for Ukraine, but could not promise that the hold would be lifted.  Vice President Pence said he would relay his support for lifting the hold to President Trump so a decision could be made on security assistance as soon as possible.  Vice President Pence spoke with President Trump that evening, but the hold was not lifted.24    Following this meeting, Ambassador Sondland pulled aside Mr. Yermak, to explain that the hold on security assistance was conditioned on the public announcement of the Burisma/Biden and the 2016 election interference investigations.  After learning of the conversation, Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassador Sondland:    The two then spoke by phone.  Ambassador Sondland explained that he had previously ng Ukrainian officials that only the White House meeting was conditioned on a public announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trump.  Hthe White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars of security assistance to Ukrainewas now conditioned on the announcement.  President mean that President Trump required that President Zelensky make a public announcement about the investigations and that a private commitment would not do.    On September 7, President Trump and Ambassador Sondland spoke.  Ambassador Sondland stated to his colleagues that the President said, President Zelensky would be required to announce the investigations in order for the hold on Ambassador Sondland passed on a similar message directly to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a Ukrainian President to make a public statement during an interview on CNN.  After speaking with Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassadors Sondland and Volker:  ing his long-held understanding that the White House meeting was conditioned on the public announcement of two political investigations desired by President Trumpand not broader anti-corruption concernsAmbassador Sondland responded hours later:   Bill, I  The President has  The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.  I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.  If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or [Secretary Pompeo] a call to discuss with them directly.  Thanks.   Ambassador ony revealed this text to be a false exculpatoryan untruthful statement that can later be used to conceal incriminating information.  In his public testimony, Ambassador direction to withhold a presidential telephone call and a White House meeting for President Zelensky were both quid pro quos designed to pressure Ukraine to announce the investigations.  He also testified that he developed a clear understanding that the military aid was also conditioned on the investigations, that it was as simple as 2+2=4.  Sondland confirmed that25  his clear understanding was unchanged after speaking with President Trump, which he then communicated to the UkrainiansPresident Zelensky had to publicly announce the two investigations if he wanted to get the meeting or the military aid.   In Ambassador conversation with the President in which the subject of a quid pro quo came up, or two, or on precisely which date the conversation took place during the period of September 6 through 9.  In one version of the conversation which Ambassador Sondland suggested may have taken place on September 9, he claimed that the President answered an open question about what he wanted from Ukraine with an immediate denialPresident told him that President Zelensky should go to a microphone and announce the investigations, and that he should want to do soeffectively confirming a quid pro quo.    Both Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, relying on their contemporaneous notes, testified that the call between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump occurred on September 7, which is further confirmed by Ambassador  on September 8 in which he wrote that President Trump.  A call on September 9, which would have occurred in the middle of the night, is at odds with the weight of the evidence and not backed up by any records the White House was willing to provide Ambassador Sondland.  Regardless of the date, Ambassador Sondland did not contest telling both Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor of a conversation he had with the President in which the President reaffirmed Am quid pro quo for the military aid.   As Ambassador Sondland acknowledged bluntly in his conversation with Mr. Holmes, personally, such as the investigations into former Vice President Biden, and not President      By early September, President Zelensky was ready to make a public announcement of the two investigations to secure a White House meeting and the military assistance his country desperately needed.  He proceeded to book an interview on CNN during which he could make such an announcement, but other events soon intervened.  On September 9, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs announced an investigation into the scheme document production and preservation requests to the White House and the State Department related to the investigation.  NSC staff members believed this investigation might have the have been26  Later that day, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) sent a letter to Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes notifying the Committee that a whistleblower had filed a complaint on August 12 that the ICIG had determined to be both unprecedented step of withholding the complaint from the Congressional Intelligence Committees, in coordination with the White House and the Department of Justice.    The White House had been aware of the whistleblower complaint for several weeks, and press reports indicate that the President was briefed on it in late August.  Tto Congress of  existence, and the announcement of a separate investigation into the same subject matter, telegraphed to the White House that attempts to condition the security assistance on the announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trumpand efforts to cover up that misconductwould not last.    On September 11, in the face of growing public and Congressional scrutiny, President Trump lifted the hold on security assistance to Ukraine.  As with the implementation of the hold, no clear reason was given.  By the time the President ordered the release of security assistance to Ukraine, DOD was unable to spend approximately 14 percent of the funds appropriated by Congress for Fiscal Year 2019.  Congress had to pass a new law to extend the funding in order to ensure the full amount could be used by Ukraine to defend itself.    Even after the hold was lifted, President Zelensky still intended to sit for an interview with CNN in order to announce the investigationsindeed, he still wanted the White House meeting.  At the urging of Ambassador Taylor, President Zelensky cancelled the CNN interview on September 18 or 19.  The White House meeting, however, still has not occurred.    The conditioning of military aid to Ukraine on the investigations sought by the President  equals four. Acting Chief of Staff, someone who meets with him daily, admitted that he had discussed security assistance with the President and that his decision to withhold it was directly tied to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation.  On October 17, at a press briefing in the White House, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that President Trump withheld the essential military aid for Ukraine as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  As Dr. Hill made clear in her testimony, this false narrative has been promoted by President Putin to deflect away from systemic interference in our election and to drive a wedge between the United States and a key partner.     during his July 25 call.  Mr. Mulvaney also   After a reporter attempted to clarify this explicit acknowledgement of a quid pro quo, Mr. Mulvaney replied:27    get over it.      Ambassador Taylor testified that in his decades of military and diplomatic service, he had never seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the President.  our -designed to benefit the political interests of the President of the United States.    In contrast, President Trump does not appear to believe there is any such limitation on his power to use White House meetings, military aid or other official acts to procure foreign help in his reelection.  When asked by a reporter on October 3 what he had hoped President Zelensky28  SECTION IIUCTION OF THE   The President Obstructed the Impeachment Inquiry by Instructing Witnesses and Agencies to Ignore Subpoenas for Documents and Testimony   An Unprecedented Effort to Obstruct an Impeachment Inquiry  Donald Trump is the first President in the history of the United States to seek to completely obstruct an impeachment inquiry undertaken by the House of Representatives under has publicly and repeatedly rejected the authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his actions and has directly challenged the authority of the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry into his actions regarding Ukraine.  President Trump ordered federal agencies and officials to disregard all voluntary requests for documents and defy all duly authorized subpoenas for records.  He also directed all federal officials in the Executive Branch not to testifyeven when compelled.    No other President has flouted the Constitution and power of Congress to conduct authority to conduct an impeachment proceeding, control the scope of a power exclusively vested in the House, and forbid any and all cooperation from the Executive Branch.  Even President Richard Nixonwho obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over key evidenceaccepted the authority of Congress to conduct an impeachment inquiry and permitted his aides and advisors to produce documents and testify to Congressional committees.    overwhelming evidence of his misconduct from courageous individuals who were willing to follow the law, comply with duly authorized subpoenas, and tell the truth.  In response, the President engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate these witnesses.  ongoing effort to thwart Congrespower risks doing grave harm to the institution of Congress, the balance of power between our branches of government, and the Constitutional order that the President and every Member of Congress have sworn to protect and defend.  Constitutional Authority for Congressional Oversight and Impeachment    Article I of the U.S. Constitution gives the House of Representatives the President who might engage in corruption or abuse of power.  Congress is empowered to conduct oversight and investigations to carry out its authorities under Article I.  Because the29    The Supreme Court has made clear that Conauthority to compel the production of information by issuing subpoenas, a power the House has   Congress has also enacted statutes to support its power to investigate and oversee the Executive Branch.  These laws impose criminal and other penalties on those who fail to comply with inquiries from Congress or block others from doing so, and they reflect the broader Constitutional requirement to cooperate with Congressional investigations.    Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiriesincluding Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clintonrecognized and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas.     President Nixon, for example, agreed to let his staff testify voluntarily in the Senate oluntarily when requested by the committee.  They will testify under oath, and they will answer fully all subpoenas as part of its impeachment inquiry, including more than 30 transcripts of White House recordings and notes from meetings with the President.  When President Nixon withheld tape recordings and produced heavily edited and inaccurate records, the House Judiciary Committee approved an article of impeachment for obstruction.       Even before the House of Representatives launched its investigation regarding Ukraine, President Trump rejected the authority of Congress to investigate his actions, proclaiming,   When the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees began achment inquiry, the President repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of the investigation in word and deed.  His rhetorical attacks appeared intended not only to dispute reports of his misconduct, but to persuade the American people that the House lacks authority to investigate the President.    maybe f his defiance has been his claims that Congress is acting in an unprecedented way and using unprecedented rules.  However, the House has been following the same investigative rules that Republicans championed when they were in control.30  On October 8, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Chairmen of the investigating Committees confirming that President Trump Cipoll  unsupported by the Constitution, judicial precedent, and more than 200 years of history.

These agencies and offices also blocked many current and former officials from producing records directly to the Committees.    identified the substance of key documents.  For example, Ambassador Gordon Sondland attached ten exhibits to his written hearing testimony reflecting reproductions of certain communications with high-level Administration officials, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  Other witnesses identified numerous additional documents that the President and various agencies are withholding that are directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry.  Like the White House, the Department of State refused to produce a single document in fact, on November 22, the Department was forced to produce 99 pages of emails, letters, notes, timelines, and news articles to a non-partisan, nonprofit ethics watchdog organization pursuant to a court order in a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Although limited in scope, this production affirms that the Department is withholding responsive documents from Congress without any valid legal basis.    No other President in history has issued an order categorically directing the entire Executive Branch not to testify before Congress, including in the context of an impeachment inquiry.  President Trump issued just such an order.    violate their legal obligations and defy House subpoenasregardless of their offices or31  positions.  President Trump even extended his order to former officials no longer employed by the federal government.  This Administration-wide effort to prevent all witnesses from providing testimony was coordinated and comprehensive.  elve current or former Administration officials refused authorized subpoenas:     Mick Mulvaney, Acting White House Chief of Staff  Robert B.

More than a dozen current and former officials followed her courageous example by testifying at depositions and public hearings over the course of the last two months.  The testimony from these witnesses produced in detail in the first section of this report.     President Trump publicly attacked and intimidated witnesses who came forward to comply with duly authorized subpoenas and testify about his misconduct, raising grave concerns about potential violations of criminal laws intended to protect witnesses appearing before Congressional proceedings.  For example, the President attacked:   Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who served the United States honorably for decades as a U.S. diplomat and anti-corruption advocate in posts around the world under six different Presidents;   Ambassador Bill Taylor, who graduated at the top of his class at West Point, served as an infantry commander in Vietnam, and earned a Bronze Star and an Air Medal with a V device for valor;   Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an active-duty Army officer for more than 20 years who earned a Purple Heart for wounds he sustained in an improvised explosive device attack in Iraq, as well as the Combat Infantryman Badge; and   and has a distinguished record of public service under the Bush, Obama, and Trump Administrations.   The President engaged in this effort to intimidate these public servants to prevent them possible retaliation, made insinuations about their character and patriotism, and subjected them to mockery and derisionwhen they deserved the oppositebroadcast to millions of Americans  It is a federal crime to intimidate or seek to intimidate any witness appearing before Congress.

Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United Statesacting personally and through his agents within and outside of the U.S. governmentsolicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.  The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his reelection, to harm the election oming presidential election to his advantage.  In so doing, the President placed his personal political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.  II. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trumpdirectly and acting through his agents within and outside the U.S. governmentnewly-elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to publicly announce unfounded reelection effort.  To advance his personal political objectives, President Trump encouraged the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.  III. As part of this scheme, President Trump, acting in his official capacity and using his position of public trust, personally and directly requested from the President of Ukraine that the government of Ukraine publicly announce investigations into (1) the Prpolitical opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, and (2) a baseless theory promoted by Russia alleging that Ukrainerather than Russiainterfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  These investigations were intended to harm political standing.    IV. President Trump ordered the suspension of $391 million in vital military assistance urgently needed by Ukraine, a strategic partner, to resist Russian aggression.  Because the aid was appropriated by Congress, on a bipartisan basis, and signed into law by the President, its expenditure was required by law.  Acting directly and through his subordinates within the U.S. government, the President withheld from Ukraine this military assistance without any legitimate foreign policy, national security, or anti-corruption justification.  The President did so despite the longstanding bipartisan support of Congress, uniform support across federal departments and agencies for the provision to Ukraine of the military assistance, and his obligations under the Impoundment Control Act.  V. President Trump used the power of the Office of the President and exercised his authority over the Executive Branch, including his control of the instruments of the federal government, to apply increasing pressure on the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian government to announce the politically-motivated investigations desired by President Trump.  Specifically, to advance and promote his scheme, the President withheld official35  acts of value to Ukraine and conditioned their fulfillment on actions by Ukraine that would benefit his personal political interests:    A. President Trumpacting through agents within and outside the U.S. governmentconditioned a head of state meeting at the White House, which the President of Ukraine desperately sought to demonstrate continued United States support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, on Ukraine publicly announcing the investigations that President Trump believed would aid his reelection campaign.  B. To increase leverage over the President of Ukraine, President Trump, acting through his agents and subordinates, conditioned release of the vital military assistance announcement of the investigations that President Trump sought.  C. including Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Energy J. Richard Perry, and other senior White House and Executive Branch officials had knowledge of, in some cases facilitated and withheld information about the scheme from the Congress and the American public.    VI. In directing and orchestrating this scheme to advance his personal political interests, President Trump did not implement, promote, or advance U.S. anti-corruption policies.  In fact, the President sought to pressure and induce the government of Ukraine to announce politically-motivated investigations lacking legitimate predication that the U.S. government otherwise discourages and opposes as a matter of policy in that country and around the world.  In so doing, the President undermined U.S. policy supporting anti-corruption reform and the rule of law in Ukraine, and undermined U.S. national security.   VII. By withholding vital military assistance and diplomatic support from a strategic foreign partner government engaged in an ongoing military conflict illegally instigated by Russia, President Trump compromised national security to advance his personal political interests.   VIII. Faced with the revelation of his actions, President Trump publicly and repeatedly persisted in urging foreign governments, including Ukraine and China, to investigate his political opponent.  This continued solicitation of foreign interference in a U.S. election presents a clear and present danger that the President will continue to use the power of his office for his personal political gain.  IX. Using the power of the Office of the President, and exercising his authority over the Executive Branch, President Trump ordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from impeachment inquiry by:36  A. information and records in the possession of the White House, in defiance of a lawful subpoena;   B. directing Executive Branch agencies to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold the production of all documents and records from the investigating Committees;   C. directing current and former Executive Branch officials not to cooperate with the Committees, including in defiance of lawful subpoenas for testimony; and   D. intimidating, threatening, and tampering with prospective and actual witnesses in the impeachment inquiry in an effort to prevent, delay, or influence the testimony of those witnesses.   In so doing, and despite the fact that the Constitution vests in the House of  the President sought to arrogate to himself the right to determine the propriety, scope, and nature of an impeachment inquiry into his own misconduct, and the right to deny any and all information to the Congress in the conduct of its constitutional responsibilities.37                 SECTION I.38  1. The President Forced Out the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine   The President forced out the United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, following a baseless smear campaign promoted by President TrumpRudy Giuliani, and others.  The campaign publicized conspiracy theories that benefited the , some of which the President raised during his July 25 call with the President of Ukraine.    Overview  On April 24, 2019, President Donald J. Trump abruptly recalled the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.  Ambassador Yovanovitch, an award-winning 33-year veteran Foreign Service officer, aggressively advocated for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine consistent with U.S. foreign policy.  President Trump forced her out following a baseless smear campaign promoted by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, associates of Mr. Giuliani, and corrupt Ukrainians.    Ambassador Yovanovitch was told by the State Department that President Trump had lost confidence in her, but she was never provided a substantive justification for her removal.  Her ouster set the stage for other U.S. officials appointed by President Trump to work in cooperation with Mr. Giuliani to advance a scheme in support of the reelection.    Mr. Giuliani and his associates promoted false conspiracy theories about Ukraine colluding with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.  This false claim was promoted by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2017less than a month after the unanimous U.S. Intelligence Community assessment that Russia alone was responsible for a covert influence campaign aimed at helping President Trump during the 2016 election.  Mr. Giuliani also made discredited public allegations about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in an   Mr. associates, with their own ties to President Trump, also worked to enter into arrangements with current and former corrupt Ukrainian officials to promote these false allegationsthe same unfounded allegations President Trump requested that Ukraine investigate on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.   President Trump amplified these baseless allegations by tweeting them just a month before he recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch.  Despite requests from Ambassador Yovanovitch and other senior State Department officials, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to issue a statement of support for the Ambassador or the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine for fear of being undermined by a tweet by President Trump.  The removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch left a vacuum in the leadership of the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine at an important time.  A new president had just been elected on an anti-corruption platform, and the country was in a period of transition as it continued to defend itself against Russia-led military aggression in the east.39  Anti-Corruption Ceremony Interrupted to Recall Anti-Corruption Ambassador  Ambassador Yovanovitch represented the United States of America as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2016 to 2019.  She is a non-partisan career public servant, first selected for the American Foreign Service in 1986.  President George W. Bush named her as his Ambassador twice, to the Kyrgyz Republic and Armenia, and President Barack Obama nominated her for the posting in Kyiv.1    On the evening of April 24, Ambassador Yovanovitch approached a podium in front of gold drapes at .  She was hosting an event to present an award of courage to the father of Kateryna Handziuk, who was brutally murdered by people who opposed her efforts to expose and root out public corruption in Ukraine.  In 2018, attackers threw sulfuric acid at Ms. Handziuk, burning more than 30 percent of her body.  After months of suffering and nearly a dozen surgeries, she died at the age of 33.2  Her attackers have still not been held to account.3    Ambassador Yovanovitch began her speech by noting that Ms. Handziuk of courage who committed herself to speaking out against wrongdoing. She lamented how Ms. Handziuk   She pledged that the United States would continue to stand with those engaged in the fight for a democratic Ukraine free of corruption,  4  Ambassador Yovanovitch concluded her remarks by up as an inspiration to the many Ukrainians striving to chart a new course for their country in the face of Russian interference and aggression:  I think we can all see what a remarkable woman Kateryna Handziuk was, but she continues to inspire all of us to fight for justice.  She was a courageous woman, who wanted to make Ukraine a better place.  And she is continuing to do so.  leave you with one thought that was expressed in Washington at the ceremonythat courage is contagious.  I think we saw that on the Maidan in 2014, we see that on the front lines every day in the Donbas, we see it in the work that Kateryna Handziuk did here in Ukraine.  And we see it in the work of all of youday in, day outfighting for Ukraine and the future of Ukraine.5  round 10:00 p.m. by a telephone   Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources Ambassador Carol Perez warned her.  Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that it is hard to know how to react to something like Ambassador Perez said she did not know what the concerns were but pledged she would 640  Finally, at 1:00 a.m. in Kyiv, Ambassador Perez called again:  The Ambassador Perez said that Ambassador Yovanovitch She warned that there Ambassador Yovanovitch asked if Ambassador Perez was referring to her physical safety, Ambassador Perez relayed that Ambassador Yovanovitch 7    Ambassador Yovanovitch asked Ambassador Perez specifically whether this order had unfounded allegations against her in the media.  Ambassador Perez sa8  Ambassador Yovanovitch argued that this order to return to Washington, D.C. irregular9  In the end, however, Ambassador Yovanovitch swiftly returned to Washington.10  Rudy Giuliani, on Behalf of President Trump, Led a Smear Campaign to Oust Ambassador Yovanovitch  followed a concerted smear campaign by Mr. Giuliani and his associates, promoted by President Trump.  The campaign was largely directed by Rudy Giuliani, attorney since early 2018.11  A cast of supporting characters, which included corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors, now-indicted middlemen, conservative media pundits, and attorneys close to President Trump, assisted Mr. Giuliani.  Among those associates were two U.S. citizens, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.  Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were Florida- 12  Both Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were criminally indicted in the Southern District of New York in October and face charges of conspiring to violate the federal ban on foreign donations and contributions in connection with federal and state elections.13  Dr. Fiona Hill, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Europe and Russian Affairs, National Security Council (NSC), learned from her colleagues t14   The campaign was also propelled by individuals in Ukraine, including two prosecutors general.  Yuriy Lutsenko served as the Prosecutor General of Ukraine under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenkothe incumbent who lost to President Zelensky in April 2019and 15  Viktor 16  Mr. Shokin has government salary, who never prosecuted anybody known for having committed a crime, and 17    1841  19    The allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, which later surfaced publicly, do-not-prosecute listdisparaging comments about President Trump.20   Ambassador Yovanovitch inferred that Mr. Lutsenko was wanted to fight against corruption, and  21  Anti-corruption reform 22  David Holmes, Counselor for Political Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine, explained that:  In mid-March 2019, an Embassy colleague learned from a Ukrainian contact that Mr. Lutsenko had complained that Ambassador Yovanovitch had, quote, unquote, destroyed him, with her refusal to support him until he followed through with his reform commitments and ceased using his position for personal gain.23     Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent similarly summarized smear campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch, which was facilitated by Mr. Giuliani and his associates, as motivated by revenge:  Over the course of 2018 and 2019, I became increasingly aware of an effort by Rudy Giuliani and others, including his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to run a campaign to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch and other officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.  The chief agitators on the Ukrainian side of this effort were some of those same corrupt former prosecutors I had encountered, particularly Yuriy Lutsenko and Viktor Shokin.  They were now peddling false information in order to extract revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct, including U.S. diplomats, Ukrainian anticorruption officials, and reform-minded civil society groups in Ukraine.24    Mr. Kent succinctly summarized[y]-corruption efforts 25  By doing her job, Ambassador Yovanovitch drew Mr.   In late 2018 and early 2019, Mr. Lutsenko also risked losing his job as Prosecutor General and possible criminal investigation, if then-candidate Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidency.  Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, Ambassador Kurt Volker, explained:   As is often the case in Ukraine, a change in power would mean change in prosecutorial powers as well, and there have been efforts in the past at prosecuting the previous government.  I think Mr. Lutsenko, in my estimation, and I said this to Mayor Giuliani when I met with him, was interested in preserving his own position.  He wanted to avoid being fired by a new government in order to prevent prosecution of himself, possible prosecution of himself.2642  Officials in Ukraine have also speculated that Mr. Lutsenko cultivated his relationship with Mr. Giuliani in an effort to hold on to his position.27  Ambassador Yovanovitch described 28    Mr. Lutsenko promoted debunked conspiracy theories that had gained traction with President Trump and Mr. Giuliani.  Those debunked conspiracy theories alleged that the Ukrainian governmentnot Russiawas behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server in 2016, and that former Vice President Biden had petitioned for the removal of Mr. Shokin to prevent an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company for which  son, Hunter, served as a board member.    Both conspiracy theories served the personal political interests of President Trump because they would help him in his campaign for reelection in 2020.  The first would serve to undercut Special Counsel Robert and his supporters.29  The second would serve to damage Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Biden.  These conspiracies lacked any basis in fact.  The Intelligence Community, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, both the Majority and Minority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the investigation undertaken by Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Russia was responsible for interfering in the 2016 election.30  former Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, said that the idea of Ukraine hacking the DNC  i31    Russia has pushed the false theory that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election to distract from its own involvement.32  advantage to promote the theory of Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections for several reasons:   First of all, to deflect from the allegations of Russian interference.  Second of all, to drive a wedge between the United States and Ukraine which Russia wants to essentially get back into its sphere of influence.  Thirdly, to besmirch Ukraine and its political leadership, [and] to degrade and erode support for Ukraine from other key partners in Europe and elsewhere.33  The allegations that Vice President Biden inappropriately pressured the Ukrainians to remove Mr. Shokin also are without merit.  Mr. Shokin was widely considered to be ineffective and corrupt.34  When he urged the Ukrainian government to remove Mr. Shokin, Vice President Biden was advocating for anti-corruption reform and pursuing official U.S. policy.35  Moreover, the World Bank, widely understood internationally to be the right policy36  In May 2019, even Mr. Lutsenko himself admitted that there was no credible evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or Vice President Biden.3743  Nevertheless, Mr. Giuliani engaged with both Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Shokin regarding these baseless allegations.  According to documents provided to the State Department Office of Inspector General, in January 23, 2019, Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas, and Mr. Fruman participated in a conference call with Mr. Shokin.  According to notes of the call, Mr. Shokin made allegations about Vice President Biden and Burisma.  Mr. Shokin also claimed that Ambassador Yovanovitch had improperly denied him a U.S. visa and that she was close to Vice President Biden.38  Mr. Giuliani separately met with Mr. Lutsenko in New York.39  Over the course of two days, on January 25 and 26, Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Lutsenko, Mr. Parnas, and Mr. Fruman, reportedly discussed whether Ambassador Yovanoviinvestigations into Burisma and the Bidens.40  For his part, Mr. Lutsenko later said he President Biden and his son, Hunter.  41    Mr. Giuliani later publicly acknowledged that he was seeking information from Ukrainians on behalf of his client, President Trump.  On October 23, Mr. Giuliani tweeted 42  Then, in a series of tweets on October 30, Mr. Giuliani stated:  All of the information I obtained came from interviews conducted as counsel to POTUS, to defend him against false allegations.  I began obtaining this information while Mueller was still investigating his witch hunt and a full 5 months before Biden even announced his run for Pres.43  ate alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and Vice President Biden negatively impacted the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.  Mr. Holmes testified:  Beginning in March 2019, the situation at the Embassy and in Ukraine changed dramatically.  Specifically, the three priorities of security, economy, and justice and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.44  U.S. national interests in Ukraine were undermined and subordinated to the personal, political interests of President Trump.   The Smear Campaign Accelerated in Late March 2019   The smear campaign entered a more public phase in the United States in late March 2019 with the publication of a series of opinion pieces in The Hill.   On March 20, 2019, John Solomon penned an opinion piece quoting a false claim by Mr. Lutsenko that Ambassador Yovanovitch had given him a do-not-prosecute list.45  Mr. Lutsenko44  later retracted the claim.46   also included false allegations that Ambassador 47  Ambassador Yovan, and the State Department issued a statement describing the allegations as a 48  The Committees uncovered evidence of close ties and frequent contacts between Mr. Solomon and Mr. Parnas, who was assisting Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of the President.  Phone records show that in the 48 hours before publication of The Hill opinion piece, Mr. Parnas spoke with Mr. Solomon at least six times.49  In addition, The Hill piece cited a letter dated May 9, 2018, from Representative Pete Sessions (R-Texas) to Secretary Pompeo, in peatedly 50  A federal criminal indictment alleges that in Yovanovitch, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.51    On March 20, 2019, the day The Hill opinion piece was published, Mr. Parnas again spoke with Mr. Solomon for 11 minutes.52  Shortly after that phone call, President Trump 53    Following President Truwere further amplified on social media and were merged with the conspiracy theories regarding both Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens.  On March 22, 2019, Mr. Giuliani tweeted: Fox News in which he raised Hunter Biden and called for an investigation.54  Then, on March 24, Donald Trump Jr. called 55    This campaign reverberated in Ukraine.  Mr. -or Yovanovitch.56  57   Concerns About President Trump Kept State Department from Issuing Statement of Support  At the end of March, as this smear campaign intensified, Ambassador Yovanovitch sent Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale an email identifying her concerns with the false allegations about her and asking for a strong statement of support from the State Department.  58  Ambassador Hale had been briefed on the smears in a series of emails from Mr. Kent.59  Ambassador Hale agreed that the allegations were without merit.60  Ambassador Yovanovitch was told that State Department officials were concerned that if they issued a public statement supporting her, 61  further negative  it might even provoke a public reaction from the President himself about the45  62  In short, 63  Ambassador Yovanovitch turned to the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, for advice.  According to Ambassador Yovanovitch, Ambassador Sondland suggested that, in response to the smear campaign, she make a public statement in support of President Trump.  She said 64  Ambassador Yovanovitch said she t I did not see how I could implement in my role as an Ambassador, and as a Foreign Service o65    Ultimately, Secretary Pompeo refused to issue a public statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch.  At the same time Secretary Pompeo was refusing to issue a statement, he was communicating with one of the individuals involved in the smear campaign against her.  State Department records show that Secretary Pompeo spoke to Mr. Giuliani on March 26 and 28, n The Hill.66  The Smear Campaign was a Coordinated Effort by Mr. Giuliani, His Associates,  and One or More Individuals at the White House  In April, Mr. Solomon continued to publish opinion pieces about Ambassador Yovanovitch and other conspiracy theories being pursued by Mr. Giuliani on behalf of President Trump.  Mr. Solomon was not working alone.  As further described below, there was a coordinated effort by associates of President Trump to push these false narratives publicly, as evidenced by public statements, phone records, and contractual agreements.    On April 1, Mr. Solomon published an opinion piece in The Hill alleging that Vice President Biden had inappropriately petitioned for the removal of Mr. Shokin to protect his son, Hunter.67  Joe Bidens 2020 Ukrainian Nightmare:  A Closed Probe is Revivedhe piece were based on information provided by Mr. Lutsenko.  The following day, Donald Trump, Jr. retweeted the article.68    Phone records obtained by the Committees show frequent communication between key players during this phase of the scheme.  Between April 1 and April 7, Mr. Parnas exchanged approximately 16 calls with Mr. Giuliani (longest duration approximately seven minutes) and approximately 10 calls with Mr. Solomon (longest duration approximately nine minutes).69    On April 7, Mr. Solomon followed up with another opinion piece.  The piece accused Ambassador Yovanovitch of preventing the issuance of U.S. visas for Ukrainian officials who wished to travel to the United States to provide purported evidence of wrongdoing Democrats and th70  One of those Ukrainian officials allegedly denied a visa was Konstiantyn Kulyk, a deputy to Mr. Lutesen-ranging 71  These Ukrainian officials claimed to have evidence of wrongdoing about Vice President46  Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election in favor of Hillary Clinton, and the misappropriation and transfer of Ukrainian funds abroad.72  The opinion piece also made clear that Mr. Giuliani was pursuing these very same theories on behalf of the President:    former mayor and former U.S. attorney in New York Citylearned about some of the allegations while, on behalf of the Trump legal team, he looked into Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election.    particularly involving Biden, his family and money spirited out of Ukraineto warrant a 73    On the same day that Mr. Solomon published these allegations, Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News.  Mr. Giuliani discussed how he learned about alleged Ukrainian interference in the   Let me tell you my interest in that.  I got information about three or four months ago that a lot of the explanations for how this whole phony investigation started will be in the Ukraine, that there were a group of people in the Ukraine that were working to help Hillary Clinton and were colluding really[LAUGHTER]with the Clinton campaign.   And it stems around the ambassador and the embassy, being used for political purposes. So I began getting some people that were coming forward and telling me about that.  And then all of a sudden, they revealed the story about Burisma and Bidens son ice President Biden] bragged about pressuring Ukraines president to firing [sic] a top prosecutor who was being criticized on a whole bunch of areas but was conducting investigation of this gas company which Hunter Biden served as a director.74  The next d75  Over the course of the four days following the April 7 article, phone records show contacts between Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas, Representative Devin Nunes, and Mr. Solomon.  Specifically, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas were in contact with one another, as well as with Mr. Solomon.76  Phone records also show contacts on April 10 between Mr. Giuliani and Rep. Nunes, consisting of three short calls in rapid succession, followed by a text message, and ending with a nearly three minute call.77  Later that same day, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Solomon had a four minute, 39 second call.78    Victoria Toensing, a lawyer who, along with her partner Joseph diGenova, once briefly investigation,79 also was in phone contact with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas at the beginning of April.80    Beginning in mid-April, Ms. Toensing signed retainer agreements between diGenova & Toensing LLP and Mr. Lutsenko, Mr. Kulyk, and Mr. Shokinall of whom feature in Mr. Solo81  In these retainer agreements, the firm agreed to represent Mr.47  Lutsenko and Mr. Kulyk in meetings with U.S. officials regarding Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, and to represent Mr. Shokin r the purpose of collecting evidence regarding his March 2016 firing as Prosecutor General of Ukraine and the role of Vice President Biden in such firing, and presenting such evidence to U.S. and foreign 82  On July 25, President Trump would personally press President Zelensky to investigate these very same matters.  On April 23, Mr. Parnas had a call with Mr. Solomon, and multiple phone contacts with Mr. Giuliani.83  On that same day, Mr. Giuliani had a series of short phone calls (ranging from 11 to 18 seconds) with a phone number associated with the White House, followed shortly thereafter by an eight minute, 28 second call with an unidentified number that called him.84  Approximately half an hour later, Mr. Giuliani had a 48 second call with a phone number associated with Ambassador John Bolton, National Security Advisor to the President.85     That same day, Mr. Giuliani tweeted:   Hillary is correct the report is the end of the beginning for the second time...NO COLLUSION.  Now Ukraine is investigating Hillary campaign and DNC conspiracy with foreign operatives including Ukrainian and others to affect 2016 election.  And 86  The next day, on the morning of April 24, Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox and Friends, lambasting the Mueller investigation.  Mr. Giuliani also promoted the false conspiracy theories about Ukraine and Vice President Biden:  And I ask you to keep your eye on Ukraine, because in Ukraine, a lot of the dirty work was done in digging up the information.  American officials were used, Ukrainian about Joe Biden from Ukraine.  About his son, Hunter Biden.  About a company he was on the board of for years, which may be one of the most crooked companies in Ukraine.  prosecutor general was investigating his son and then the investigation went south.87  Later that day, Mr. Giuliani had three phone calls with a number associated with OMB, and eight calls with a White House number.88  One of the calls with the White House was four minutes, 53 seconds, and another was three minutes, 15 seconds.     Later that evening, the State Department phoned Ambassador Yovanovitch and abruptly 89  Ambassador Yovanovitch Was Informed That the   When Ambassador Yovanovitch returned to the United States at the end of April, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan informed her Trump48  leadership.90  Ukraine, and that, in fact, the President had been pushing for my removal since the prior 91  Ambassador Philip T. Reeker, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, offered a similar assessment.  He explained to Ambassador 92    Counselor of the Department of State T.

Three days later, President Trump met in the Oval Office with his hand-picked delegation and gave them the talk with Rudy  about Ukraine.95  The President Provided No Rationale for the Recall of Ambassador Yovanovitch  Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that she was never provided a justification for why President Trump recalled her.96  Only two months earlier, in early March 2019, Ambassador Yovanovitch had been asked by Ambassador Hale to extend her assignment as Ambassador to Ukraine until 2020.97    Ambassador Hale testified that Ambassador Yovanovitch 98  99  During her more than three-decade career, Ambassador Yovanovitch received a number of awards, including:  in Human Rights Award, the Senior Foreign Service Performance Award six times, and the State  Honor Award five times.100    Career foreign service officer Ambassador P. Michael McKinley, former Senior Advisor 101  Ambassador Reeker described her ,precise, veryvery professional,an excellent mentor,102  Ambassador Yovanovitch Strongly Advocated for the U.S. Policy to Combat Corruption  Throughout the course of her career, and while posted to Kyiv, Ambassador Yovanovitch was a champion of49  Mr. Kent described U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine as encompassing the priorities of fense sector reform, and the ability to stand 103  and remainsa top U.S. 104  Additionally, she testified that an honest and accountable Ukrainian leadership makes a U.S.-Ukrainian partnership more reliable and more valuable to the United States.105  Mr. Holmes testified that Ambassador Yovanovitch was successful in implementing anti-corruption reform-fought passage of a law 106  Mr. Holmes said Ambassador .107  The  reforms achieved by Ambassador Yovanovitch helped reduce the problem faced by many post-Soviet countries of selective corruption prosecutions to target political opponents.108    There was a broad consensus that Ambassador Yovanovitch was successful in helping Ukraine combat pervasive and endemic corruption.      While ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the president, the manner and circumstances were unusual and raise questions of motive.109  Ambassador Yovanovitch falsely.110  She  apparently felt stymied conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador using unofficial back  111     Dr. Hill similarly testified that while the President has the authority to remove an 112   Recall of Yovanovitch Threatened U.S.-Ukraine Policy  undermined U.S. diplomatic efforts in Ukraine, a key U.S. partner and a expansion into Europe.  As Ambassador Yovanovitch explained:  Ukrainians were wondering whether I was going to be leaving, whether we really represented the President, U.S. policy, et cetera.  And so I think it wasyou know, it really kind of cut the ground out from underneath us.113  Summarizing the cumulative impact of the attacks, she emphasized:  is kneecapped it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the 11450   without an ambassador at a time of electoral change in Ukraine and when the Embassy was also without a deputy chief of mission.  Mr. Kent explained:  During the late spring and summer of 2019, I became alarmed as those efforts bore fruit.  They led to the outer [ouster] of Ambassador Yovanovitch and hampered U.S. efforts to establish rapport with the new Zelensky administration in Ukraine.115    One of the unfortunate elements of the timing was that we were also undergoing a transition in my old job as deputy chief of mission.  The person who replaced me had already been moved early to be our DCM and Charge in Sweden, and so we had a temporary acting deputy chief of mission.  So that left the embassy not only withoutthe early withdrawal of Ambassador Yovanovitch left us not only without an Ambassador but without somebody who had been selected to be deputy chief of mission.116  It was not until late May that Secretary Pompeo asked Ambassador Bill Taylor, who had previously served as Ambassador to Ukraine, to return to Kyiv  to lead the embassy while it awaited a confirmed Ambassador.  Ambassador Taylor did not arrive in Kyiv until June 17, more than a month after Ambassador Yovanovitch officially left Kyiv.117  His mission to carry out U.S. objectives there would prove challenging in the face of ongoing efforts by Mr. Giuliani and othersat the direction of the Presidentto secure investigations demanded by the President to help his reelection.51  2. The President Put Giuliani and the Three Amigos in Charge of Ukraine Issues   After President Trump recalled Ambassador Yovanovitch, his personal agent, Rudy -elected president to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election.  President Trump directed his own political appointees to coordinate with Mr. Giuliani on Ukraine, while National Security Council officials benefit of the President.  Officials at the highest levels of the White House and Trump    Overview  On April 21, 2019, the day that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was elected as president of Ukraine, President Trump called to congratulate him.  After a positive callin which Mr. Zelensky complimented President Trump and requested that President Trump attend his inaugurationPresident Trump instructed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the U.S. delegation to the inauguration.  However, on May 13before the inauguration date was even setPresident Trump instructed Vice President Pence not to attend.    Rudy Giuliani also announced a plan to visit Ukraine in mid-May 2019not on official U.S. government business, but instead to pursue on behalf of his client, President Trump, the debunked conspiracy theories about alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and discredited claims about the Bidens.  After public scrutiny in response to his announced visit, Mr. Giuliani cancelled his trip and alleged that President-elect Zelensky was surrounded by    Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and Ambassador Kurt Volker, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, ultimately led the U.S. delegation to  inauguration.  Upon returning to Washington, D.C., the three U.S. officialsdebriefed the President in the Oval Office and encouraged him to engage with President Zelensky.  Instead of accepting h him on Ukraine matters.  They followed   Dr. Fiona Hill, Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Europe and Russian Affairs at the National Security Council, would later observe that Ambassador Sondland g involved in a domestic political errand, and we [the NSC staff] were being involved52  -Corruption Platform   On April 21, popular comedian and television actor, Volodymyr Zelensky, won a and unseating the incumbent Petro Poroshenko.  Mr. Zelensky, who had no prior political experience, told voters a week before his victory: 118  Five years earlier, in late 2013, Ukrainians had gathered in Kyiv and rallied against the corrupt government of former President Viktor Yanukovych, corruption and pursue closer partnership with the West.119   Following the election results, at 4:29 p.m. Eastern Time, President Trump was connected by telephone to President-120     According to a call record released publicly by the White House, President Trump did not openly express doubts about the newly-elected leader.121  And contrary to a public readout of the call originally issued by the White House, President Trump did not mention corruption in Ukraine, despite the NSC staff preparing talking points on that topic.122  was not mentioned once during the April 21 conversation, according to the official call record.123   In the call, President-invited him to visit Ukraine for his upcoming inaugurationa gesture that President Trump 124  President Trump told Mr. Zelensky:   and wellrepresentative.  Or more than one from the United States will be with you on that great day.  So, we will have somebody, at a minimum, at a very, very high level, and they will be with you.125   went onbe best for you to see it yourself.  So, if you can come, that would be great.  So again, I invite 126  u about your country and I 127  In a nod to his past experience working with Ukraine as a businessman, 128  President Trump then invited Mr. Zeleinvitation, a129     Mr. Zelensky then reiterated his interest in President Trump attending his inauguration,53  130  Shortly after the April 21 call, Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia, learned that President Trump asked Vice President Pence to attend Mr. 131  Ms. Williams testified that in a separate phone call between Vice President Pence and President-invitation 132  Kyiv.133  Rudy Giuliani and his Associates Coordinated Efforts to Secure and Promote the Investigations with Ukrainian President Zelensky  As previously explained in Chapter 1, Mr. Giuliani, acting on behalf of President Trump, had for months engaged corrupt current and former Ukrainian officials, including Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko.  The April election of Mr. Zelensky, however, raised the possibility that Mr. Lutsenko might lose his job as Prosecutor General once Mr. Zelensky took power.      In the immediate aftermath of President-elect iani continued publicly to project confidence that Ukraine would deliver on investigations related to the Bidens.  On April 24before Ambassador Yovanovitch received calls abruptly summoning her back to WashingtonMr. Giuliani stated in an interview on Fox and Friends that viewers should,  Biden from Ukraine.  About his son, Hunter Biden.  About a company he was on the board of for years, which may be one of the most crooked companies in Ukraine.134  Behind the scenes, however, Mr. Giuliani was taking steps to engage the new Ukrainian leader and his aides.  The day before, on April 23, the same day that Vice President Pence confirmed his plans to attend President-consisting of Lev Parnas and Igor Frumanto meet with Ihor Kolomoisky, a wealthy Ukrainian with ties to President-elect Zelensky.  Instead of going to Kyiv, they booked tickets to Israel, where they met with Mr. Kolomoisky.135  2016, when Ukrainian authorities nationalized the failing financial institution.  Although he denied allegations of committing any crimes, Mr. Kolomoisky subsequently left Ukraine for Israel, where he remained until President Zelensky assumed power.136   Mr. Kolomoisky confirmed to The New York Times that he met with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman in late April 2019.  He claimed they sought his assistance in facilitating a meeting between Mr. Giuliani and President-uested meeting.13754  Mr. Giuliani was not deterred.    During the time surrounding Ambassador Yovano, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas connected over a flurry of calls around a planned trip to Ukraine by Mr. Giuliani, which he would eventually cancel after growing public scrutiny.  As previously described in Chapter 1, call records obtained by the Committees show a series of contacts on April 23 and 24 between Mr. Giuliani, the White House, Mr. Parnas, and John Solomon, among others.138    On April 25, 2019, former Vice President Biden publicly announced his campaign for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States and launched his effort to unseat President Trump in the 2020 election.139    That evening, Mr. Solomon published a new opinion piece in The Hill about alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 140    Meanwhile, in Kyiv, David Holmes, Counselor for Political Affairs at U.S. Embassy Ivan Bakanov, seeking a channel to the newly-elected leader.

It sounds very interesting with Ukraine.  I just spoke to the new president a little while ago, two days ago, and congratulated him on an incredible race.  146   As Mr. Holmes later learned on July 26 from Ambassador Sondland, President Trump such as the investigation into Vice President Biden.14755  In the same Fox News interview, Mr. Hannity asked President Trump whether America needed to see the purported evidence possessed by the unnamed Ukrainians noted in Mr.   Well, I think we do.  And, frankly, we have a great new attorney general who has done an unbelievable job in a very short period of time.  And he is very smart and tough and I would certainly defer to him.

You know that, and I would certainly defer to the attorney general.  And 148  Ryaboshapka, who assumed his new position in late August 2019, told The Financial Times in late November 2019 that Attorney General Barr had made no contact regarding a potential investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by former Vice President Biden.149  demand for Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections, Mr. important for the west not to pull us into some conflicts between their ruling elites, but to 150  President Trump Promoted False Information About Former Vice President Joe Biden  In early May, Mr. Giuliani continued his outreach to President-elect Zelensky and promoted the need for Ukrainian investigations into former Vice President Biden that served   On May 2, at 6:21 a.m. Eastern Time, President Trump retweeted a link to an article in The New York Times, which assessed that Trump is endorsing an effort to push a foreign government to proceed with a case that could hurt 151    Later that evening, in an interview with Fox News at the White House, President Trump referenced the false allegations about the firing of a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor 152  President Trump replied:     see what that is.

On May 7, 2019, Christopher Wray, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies regarding foreign interference in U.S. elections:  My view is that, if any public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any nation-state or anybody acting on behalf of a nation-state about influencing or interfering with our election, then that is something that the FBI would want to know about. 157    Mr. Giuliani nonetheless pressed forward with his plan to personally convey to President-elect Zelensky, on behalf of his client President Trump, the importance of opening investigations   On the morning of May 8, Mr. Giuliani called the White House Switchboard and connected for six minutes and 26 seconds with someone at the White House.158  That same day, Mr. Giuliani also connected with Mr. Solomon for almost six minutes, with Mr. Parnas, and with 159   During a meeting that same day, Ukraine Minister of Interior Arsen Avakov disclosed to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman would soon 160  Minister yor Giuliani had reached out to him and invited him to 161  Although he declined that offer, Minister Avakov indicated that he intended to accept their new invitation to meet in Kyiv.162  The next day, on May 9, The New York Times publicized Ukraine.163  Mr. Giuliani confirmed that he planned to meet with President Zelensky and press the Ukrainians to pursue investigations that President Trump promoted only days earlier on Fox News.164  The New York Times described57  [P]art of a monthslong effort by the former New York mayor and a small group of Trump allies working to build interest in the Ukrainian inquiries.

But, Mr. Giuliani argued:   rmy client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.167    According to Mr. Giuliani, the President fully supported putting pressure on Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit his 2020 reelection campaign.168  Mr. Giuliani emphasized that 169  Underscoring his commitment to pressuring Ukraine until it opened the investigations President Trump promoted on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani told The Washington Post 170   On May 9, following public revelation of his trip by the New York Times, Mr. Giuliani connected in quick succession with Mr. Solomon and then Mr. Parnas for several minutes at a time.171  Mr. Giuliani then made brief connections with the White House Switchboard and Situation Room several times, before connecting at 1:43 p.m. Eastern Time with someone at the White House for over four minutes.172  He connected, separately, thereafter with Mr. Parnas several times in the afternoon and into the evening.173         That evening, Mr. Giuliani tweeted:  If you doubt there is media bias and corruption then when Democrats conspiring with Ukrainian officials comes out remember much of the press, except for Fox, the Hill, and NYT, has suppressed it. If it involved @realDonaldTrump or his son it would have been front page news for weeks.174   Shortly thereafter, on the night of May 9, he made an appearance on Fox News and reiterated that his trip to Ukraine interests by pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens:58  election day without this being investigated, not because I want to see him investigated.

Shortly after 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time, Mr. Giuliani also spoke with Ambassador Volker on the phone. 177 Ambassador Volker t specifically, the debunked story that Vice President Biden had improperly pressured Ukraine to fire a corrupt prosecutor general, as well as the Russian-backed conspiracy that the Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.178  Ambassador Volker testified that he had a simple warning for Mr. Giuliani: 179  Call records obtained by the Committees reveal that their call lasted more than 30 minutes.180    Call records also show that around midday on May 10, Mr. Giuliani began trading previously served on Ranking Member Devin NuAmbassador Volker.

Russian President Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Orban  Counseled President Trump on Ukraine   In early May, Mr. Giuliani was not the only person who conveyed his skepticism of Ukraine to President Trump.  The President reportedly discussed Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin when they spoke by phone on May 3.  President Trump posted on Twitter that he an apparent reference to the unanimous finding by the U.S. Intelligence Community that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the aim of assisting President y.191  for Europe and Russia, that President Putin also expressed negative views about Ukraine to -elect   He denies the existence of Ukraine as a nation and a country, as he told President Bush in to the death of 13,000 Ukrainians on Ukrainian territory since 2014 as a result of that Ukraine does not survive independently.192  On May 13, President Trump met one-on-one for an hour with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

It was initially quite a long list. We had asked who would be the senior [U.S.] member of that delegation.  We were told that Vice President Pence was likely to be that senior member, it was not yet fully agreed to.  And so we were anticipating that to be the case.

E-mail messages described to the Committees by Ambassador Sondland showed that he informed Mr. Mulvaney, Ambassador Bolton, and Secretaries Pompeo and Perry, as well as their immediate staffs, of his Ukraine-related efforts on behalf of the President.251    According to Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry agreed to reach out to Mr. Giuliani 252  Secretary Perry discussed with Mr. Giuliani the political concerns that President Trump articulated in the May 23 meeting.253    Dr. Hill testified that Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Secretary Perry every impression that they were meeting with Rudy Giuliani at this point, and Rudy Giuliani was also saying on the television, and indeed has said subsequently, that he was closely 254  255    Like Dr. Hill, Ambassador Bolton also closely trackeof the President.  256  During a meeting on June 13, Ambassador Bolton made clear that he65  257  According to Ambassador Bolton, 258  259  Ambassador Bolton also reportedly joined Dr. Hill in warning Ambassador Volker against contacting Mr. Giuliani.260  Dr. Hill was particularly concerned about engagement with engage with someone who is spreading untruths, the more 261  She further testified that she also discussed Mr. 262  On June 18, Ambassador Volker, Acting Assistant Secretary of State Ambassador Philip T.

And I had not put my finger on that at the moment, but I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn't fully coordinating.

The President Froze Military Assistance to Ukraine   The President froze military assistance to Ukraine against U.S. national security interests and over the objections of career experts.   Overview  Since 2014, the United States has maintained a bipartisan policy of delivering hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine each year.  These funds benefit the security of the United States and Europe by ensuring that Ukraine is equipped to defend itself against Russian aggression.  In 2019, that bipartisan policy was undermined when President Trump ordered, without justification, a freeze on military assistance to Ukraine.   For fiscal year 2019, Congress authorized and appropriated $391 million in security Financing program.  In July 2019, however, President Trump ordered the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to put a hold on all $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine.    The hold surprised experts from DOD and the State Department.  DOD had already announced its intent to deliver security assistance to Ukraine after certifying that the country had implemented sufficient anti-corruption reforms, and the State Department was in the process of notifying Congress of its intent to deliver foreign military financing to Ukraine.  In a series of interagency meetings, every represented agency other than OMB (which is headed by Mick assistance to Ukraine and objected to State Department, and the National Security Council (NSC) argued that it was in the national security interest of the United States to continue to support Ukraine.  Agency experts also expressed concerns about the legality of President Trump withholding assistance to Ukraine that Congress had already appropriated for this express purpose.    assistance.  On July 25, 2019, OMB began using a series of footnotes in funding documents to notify DOD that the assistance funds were temporarily on hold to allow for interagency review.  Throughout August and September, OMB continued to use this method and rationale to maintain the hold, long after the final interagency meeting on Ukraine assistance occurred on July 31.  The hold continued despite concerns from DOD that the hold would threaten its ability to fully spend the money before the end of the fiscal year, as legally required.    On July 25officials -August, officials at DOD, the State Department, and the NSC received numerous questions from Ukrainian on August 28, 2019.68  Security Assistance to Ukraine is Important to U.S. National Security Interests  The United States has an interest in providing security assistance to Ukraine to support the country in its longstanding battle against Russian aggression and to shore it up as an independent and democratic country that can deter Kremlin influence in both Ukraine and other European countries.  In early 2014, in what became known as the Revolution of Dignity, Ukrainian citizens demanded democratic reforms and an end to corruption, thereby forcing the ouster of pro-dent.  Shortly thereafter, Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine, as well as the ongoing, Russian-led armed conflict in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.  Approximately 13,000 people have been killed as a result of the conflict and over 1.4 million people have been displaced.278    eastern Ukraine report directly to the Russian military, which arms them, trains them, leads them, 279  Similarly, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, during a visit  seeking to redraw international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free nations of 280    visa sanctions on Russian individuals and entities, and committed to providing billions of dollars in economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine to continue to support its sovereignty and democratic development.    The European Union is the single largest contributor of total foreign assistance to U281  In addition to economic and humanitarian assistance, the United States has contributed a substantial amount of security assistance, mostly lethal and non-lethal military equipment and training, to Ukraine.  In fact, the United States is the largest contributor of security assistance to Ukraine.  Since 2014, the United States has delivered approximately $1.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine.282  Multiple witnessesincluding Ambassador William Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Coopertestified that this security assistance to Ukraine is vital to the national security of the United States and Europe.283  As Ambassador Taylor noted:   [R]adar and weapons and sniper rifles, communication, that saves lives.  It makes the show that the Ukrainians can defend themselves and the Russians, in the end, will say 284   State Department Special Advisor for Ukraine, Catherine Croft, further emphasized that  against 285  Ambassador Taylor testified that American aid is a concrete 28669  Witnesses also testified that it is in the interest of the United States for Russian aggression to be halted in Ukraine.  In the 20th century, the United States fought two bloody wars to resist the aggression of a hostile power that tried to change the borders of Europe by force.  As Ambassador Taylor put it, Russian aggressi287    Timothy Morrison, former Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the NSC, put the importance of U.S. assistance in stark terms:   Russia is a failing power, but it is still a dangerous one.  The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia over thhere.288  Bipartisan Support for Security Assistance to Ukraine  Congressional support for security assistance to Ukraine has been overwhelming and bipartisan.  Congress provided $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine for fiscal year 2019:  $250 million through the DOD-administered Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) and $141 million through the State Department-administered Foreign Military Financing program.  On September 26, 2018, Congress appropriated $250 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is funded through DOD.  The funding law made clear that the on September 28, 2018.289  The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiativea Congressionally-mandated program codifying portions of the European Reassurance Initiative, which was originally launched by the Obama Administration in 2015intelligence support, including training, equipment, and logistics support, supplies and services, 290  Recognizing that  to helping it break free of the security assistance funds.  Half of the money was held in reserve until the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, certified to Congress that Ukraine had undertaken sufficient anti-corruption reforms, such as in civilian control of the military and increased transparency and accountability.291   On February 28, 2019, John C. Rood, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, notified Congress that DOD intended to deliver the first half ($125 million) of assistance appropriated in -artillery radars and defensive lethal assista292  Congress cleared the Congressional notification, which enabled DOD to begin obligating (spending) funds.293   For Ukraine to qualify to receive the remaining $125 million of assistance, Congress required that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, certify that the70  Government of Ukraine had taken substantial anticorruption reform actions.294  Ms. Cooper and others at DOD conducted a review to evaluate whether Ukraine had met the required benchmarks.295  Ms. Cooper explained 296     On May 23, 2019, Under Secretary Rood certified to Congress that Ukraine had completed the requisite defense institutional reforms to qualify for the remaining $125 million in funds.  He wrote:   On behalf of the Secretary of Defense, and in coordination with the Secretary of State, I have certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.297  Congress then cleared the related Congressional notification, which enabled DOD to begin obligating the remaining $125 million in funds.298   On June 18, 2019, DOD issued a press release announcing its intention to provide $250 million in security assistaassistance would provide Ukraine with sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and counter-artillery radars, command and control, electronic warfare detection and secure communications, military mobility, night vision, and military medical treatment.299  On February 15, 2019, Congress also appropriated $115 million for Ukraine through the State Department-administered Foreign Military Financing Program (FMF).300  The Foreign Military Financing Program is administered by the State Department and provides grants or loans to foreign countries to help them purchase military services or equipment manufactured by U.S. companies in the United States.  In addition to the $115 million appropriated for fiscal year 2019, approximately $26 million carried over from fiscal year 2018.301  Thus, the total amount of foreign military financing available for Ukraine was approximately $141 million.    Before a country receives foreign military financing, the State Department must first seek Congressional approval through a notification to Congress.302  The State Department never sent the required Congressional notification to Congress in the spring or summer of 2019.  As described below, OMB blocked the notification.303  President Trump Had Questions About Ukraine Security Assistance  The day after DOD issued its June 18 press release announcing $250 million in security assistance funds for Ukraine, President Trump started asking OMB questions about the funding for Ukraine.  On June 19, Mark Sandy, Deputy Associate Director for National Security Programs at OMB, was copied on an email from his boss, Michael Duffey, Associate Director for National Security Programs at OMB, to Elaine McCusker, Deputy Under Secretary of71  nd that 304  Notably, the same day, President Trump gave an interview on Fox News where he raised the so-Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, a line he would repeat during his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president.305     306  Mr. Sandy shared the document with Mr. Duffey, who had follow-307  Mr. Sandy said that his staff provided the relevant information to Mr. Duffey, but he did not know whether Mr. Duffey shared the information with the White House.308    Ms. Cooper also recalled receiving an email inquiring about DOD-administered Ukraine security assist309  The email was from -up on a meeting with the   And the one question was related to U.S. industry.

It asked, what are other countries doing, something to that effect.  And then the third question, I dowording, but it was something to the effect of, you know, who gave this money, or who gave this funding?310  311  Ms. Cooper noted e President, and that she and her staff 312  According to Ms. Cooper, DOD officials never received a response.313    President Trump Froze Military Assistance  Despite the fact that DOD experts demonstrated that the security assistance was crucial for both Ukraine and U.S. national security and had strong bipartisan support in Congress, President Trump ordered OMB to freeze the funds in July.   On July 3, the State Department notified DOD and NSC staff that OMB was blocking the State Department from transmitting a Congressional notification for the provision of State Department-administered security assistance to Ukraine (i.e., the $141 million in foreign military financing).314  Because the State Department is legally required to transmit such a notification to Congress before spending funds, blocking the Congressional notification effectively barred the State Department from spending the funding.315  Ms. Williams testified that she saw the news in72  a draft email that was being prepared as part of the nightly update for the National Security Advisor.316  cussed previously by OMB or the NSC.317  On or about July 12, 2019, President Trump directed that a hold be placed on security assistance funding for Ukraine.  That day, Robert Blair, Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff, sent an email to Mr. Duffey at OMB about Ukraine security assistance.318  Mr. Sandy, who was on personal leave at the time but later received a copy of the President is d319  The email mentioned no concerns about any other country, security assistance package, or aid of any sort.320  On or about July 15, Mr. Morrison learned from Deputy National Security Advisor Charles 321  On or about July 17 or 18, 2019, Mr. Duffey and Mr. Blair again exchanged emails about Ukraine security assistance.322  Mr. Sandy later received a copy of the emails, which showed that when Mr. Duffey asked Mr. Blair about the reason for the hold, Mr. Blair provided no explanation and President.323   On July 18 or 19, when he returned from two weeks of personal leave, Mr. Sandy learned for the first time that the President had placed a hold on Ukraine security assistance from Mr. Duffey.324  325    Agency Experts Repeatedly Objected to the Hold on Security Assistance  Between July 18 and July 31, 2019, the NSC staff convened a series of interagency meetings, at which the hold on security assistance was discussed in varying degrees of detail.  Over the course of these meetings, it became evident that:    the President directed the hold through OMB;    no justification was provided for the hold;    with the exception of OMB, all represented agencies supported Ukraine security assistance because it was in the national security interests of the United States; and    there were concerns about the legality of the hold.   The first interagency meeting was held on July 18 at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level - 326  Ambassador Taylor, Lt. Col. Vindman, Ms. Croft, and Mr. Kent were among the attendees.  Witnesses testified that OMB announced at the meeting that President Trump had directed a hold on Ukraine security assistance.  Mr. Kent testified that at the meeting, an OMB staff person announced that Acting White73  327  Ambassador Taylor when he le328    329  Ambassador 330  David Holmes, Political Counselor at the 331  He thought the hold undermined what he had understood to be longstanding U.S. policy in Ukraine.332  333  Ms. Cooper, who did not participate but received a readout of the meeting, 334  Mr. understand why that had happe335  336    With the exception of OMB, all agencies present at the July 18 meeting advocated for the lifting of the hold.337    There was also a lack of clarity as to whether the hold applied only to the State Department-administered Foreign Military Financing to Ukraine or whether it also applied to the DOD-administered Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funding.338  Ms. Cooper and her 339  After the meeting, DOD sought further clarification from the NSC and State Department about its impact on the DOD-administered funding.340  341    The second interagency meeting to discuss the hold on Ukraine security assistance was 2019.342  The meeting was chaired by Mr. Morrison.343  Ms. Cooper, who participated via secure 344  Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor to Vice President Pence for Europe and Eurasia, who also attended the meeting been directed by the Chief of Staff, the White House Chief of Staff, to continue holding it [the 345  Similar to the July 18 meeting, the July 23 -administered funding or only to the funds administered by the State Department.346    Again, no reason was provided for the hold.347  Mr. Sandy did not attend the July 23 meeting as the representative for OMB, but he received a readout that other agencies expressed concerns about the hold.  Specifically, the concerns related to the lack of rationale for the hold, 34874  Mr. Morrison also testified that there was a discussion at the July 23 meeting about the 349  Mr. Morrison recalled that DOD raised concerns about possible violations of the Impoundment Control Act.350  The Impoundment Control Act gives the President the authority to delay spending, or not spend, funds only if Congress is notified of those intentions and approves the proposed action (see below for further discussion of the act).351   With the exception of OMB, all agencies present at the July 23rd meeting advocated for the lifting of the hold.352  er, on behalf of of the security assistance.353  Lt. Col. Vindman, who also attended the meeting, testified that there was agreement that the issue should be elevat354    The third interagency meeting, a Deputies Small Group meeting at the Cabinet Deputies level, was held on July 26, 2019.  Mr. Duffey was the OMB representative, and Mr. Sandy prepared Mr. Duffey for the meeting.355  Mr. Sandy explained that he prepared Mr. Duffey to get policy guidance on six critical issues:  (1) the reason for the hold; (2) the extent of the hold; (3) the duration of the hold; (4) the Congressional affairs approach; (5) the public affairs approach; and (6) and the diplomatic approach.356  Mr. Sandy testified that on July 26, OMB still did not have an understanding of the reason for the hold.357  According to Mr. Sandy, at that time, there was no discussion within OMB about the amount of money that was being contributed to 358    Mr. Morrison, Lt. Col. Vindman, Ms. Cooper, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale, and Mr. Duffey attended the July 26 meeting.  At the meeting, OMB stated 359  Department and Defense Department security assistance funds.360  Ambassador Hale, as the  as did representatives from all agencies other than OMB.361  and the Chief of that the President was concerned about corruption in Ukraine, and he wanted to make s362  Ms. Cooper had a similar recollection but received no further understanding of what OMB meant by 363  Ms. Cooper recalled that the deputies did not consider corruption to be a legitimate reason for the hold because they unanimously agreed that Ukraine was making sufficient progress on anti-corruption reforms, as had been certified by DOD on May 23.364  President Trump Continued the Hold Despite Agency Concerns About Legality  Prior to the passage of the Impoundment Control Act, presidents had frequently impoundedi.e., refused to spendCongressionally-appropriated funds to enforce their policy75  small (i.e., no more than a few percent of the total program budget) or temporary (i.e., funds were released in time for them to be spent before the end of the fiscal year) and rooted in policy, rather than political interests of the President.  It was not until President Nixon that presidential impoundment of funds would prompt Congress to take action citing constitutional concerns.365  Unlike his predecessors, Nixon undertook impoundments that were both substantial and, in some cases, permanent, which raised concerns for Congress over its Article I powers.  In fact, between 1969 and 1972, Nixon impounded between 15% and 20% of Congressionally-appropriated funds in various accounts.366   To reassert Congressional authority over the budget, in 1973, Congress established the Joint Study Committee on Budget Control, which held a series of hearings and produced more to the overwhelmingly bipartisan passages vetoof the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, one of a series of reform bills designed to reign in presidential power.  Looking back at that moment in history, Rep. Bill Archer (R-TX), a fiscal conservative who served 30 years in the House of Representatives, including as the Chairman of the Ways and 367  In addition to establishing the Congressional Budget Committees and the independent Congressional Budget Office, the Impoundment Control Act also limits the circumstances under which a president can legally impound Congressionally-appropriated funds.  According to the Act, although the President may request authority from Congress to withhold or permanently cancel the availability of budget authority, such an action is not allowed without Congressional approval.  Any amount of budget authority proposed to be deferred (i.e., temporarily withheld) or rescinded (i.e., permanently withheld) must be made available for obligation unless Congress, within 45 legislative days, completes action on a bill rescinding all or part of the amount proposed for rescission.368  The Impoundment Control Act does not permit the withholding of funds through their date of expiration, which would be a de facto rescission without Congressional approval.369  At the July 26 interagency meeting, senior agency officials raised serious concerns about the legality of the hold under the Impoundment Control Act.  Ms. Cooper testified:   A: began to raise concerns about how this could be done in a legal fashion because there was broad understanding in the meeting that the fundingthe State Department funding related to an earmark for Ukraine and that the DOD funding was specific to Ukraine security assistance.  So the comments in the room at the could legally play out.  And at that meeting the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.   Q: Okay.  So is it fair to say the deputies thought the President was not authorized to place a hold on these funds?76  A: They did not use that term, but the expression in the room that I recall was a sense that there was not an available mechanism to simply not spend money that has been in the case of USAI [DOD security assistance] already notified to Congress.370   evated to a PC [Principals could be obligated before the end of the fiscal year.371  A Principals Committee meeting was never convened.372  According to Mr. Morrison, National Security Advisor reasonable idea of where the principals were, and he wanted to get directly to the President as 373  Ambassador Bolton understood that the  374  As had been clear 375  At this point, it remained unclear to many officials why the President continued to hold the funds.  On July 31, 2019, a fourth and final interagency meeting was held at the Policy Coordination Committee level.  Ms. Cooper attended the meeting on behalf of DOD.  According telection 376  Ms. Cooper nevertheless raised security assistance and expressed her understanding, after consulting with DOD counsel, that there were only two legally available options to implement the hold: a already appropriated) or for the Defense Department to do a reprogramming action (i.e., use Congressionally-appropriated funds for a different purpose).377  In either case, the law requires that the Executive Branch notify, and seek approval from, Congress before taking any action.378  are only two would have to start obligating the funds on or about August 6.379  She explained at her deposition that DOD would have had to begin obligating the funds by that date or risk violation of the Impoundment Control Act.380   The Administration, however, never proposed a rescission or reprogramming of funds for Ukraine security assistance and never notified Congress of its intent to withhold funds.381   OMB Used Unusual Process to Implement   OMB plays a critical role in the release of security assistance funding.  The Antideficiency Act requires that, before any department or agency may spend Congressionally-appropriated funding, the Director of OMB available to spend) the funds in writing.382  Through this mechanism, OMB has the ability to directly impact security assistance funding or funding of any kind that is appropriated by Congress.77  In parallel with the interagency meetings that occurred during the latter half of July 2019, Congressional notifications of February 28 and May 23.  Over the course of his twelve-year career at OMB, Mr. Sandy could not recall any other time when a hold had been placed on security assistance after a Congressional notification had been sent.383    When speaking with Mr. Duffey on or about July 18 or 19, Mr. Sandy immediately raised concerns about how to implement the hold without violating the Impoundment Control Act, which required that the funds be obligated (i.e. spent) before they expired at the end of the fiscal year, on September 30.384  In light of that legal requirement, the hold would have to be temporary.385  An additional hurdle was the fact that OMB had already authorized DOD to spend the security assistance funds DOD administered for fiscal year 2019.386  Therefore, when President Trump directed the hold in July, OMB scrambled to reverse that prior authorization.    From July 19 through July 24, Mr. Sandy consulted with the OMB Office of General Counsel as well as Ms. McCusker at DOD on how to legally implement a hold on the funds.387  388  Based on these consultations, OMB decided to implement the hold through a series of nine funding 389  Apportionments typically are used to convey authority to an agency to spend funds, not to withhold funds; thus, in order to bar DOD from spending money, these particular apportionments included footnotes that would impose the holds e of the footnote was to preclude obligation for a limited period of time but enable planning and 390  He also testified that this use of footnotes was unusual and that in his 391    On July 25, OMB issued the first funding document implementing the hold.  In this document, the relevant footnote notified DOD that the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative 2019, to allow for an interagency process   the Department that this brief pause in obligations will not pexecution of the final policy direction.  DOD may continue its planning and casework for the Initiative during this period.392  the NSC-led interagency meetings convened during the latter half of July, and that the August 5 on the hold.393  The August 5 date was determined in consultation with Mr. Duffey at OMB and Ms. McCusker at DOD.394  Mr. Sandy further testified that the second sentence in the footnotewhich states, in  was critical to the implementation of the hold:78  Impoundment Control Act, which means that you have to allow for the timely execution.  And this reflects my conversation withconversations plural with Elaine McCusker that they can confirm that, during this brief period, they would not foresee any problem fully executing the program by the end of the fiscal year.395   The sentence, in effect, affirmed that if the hold remained in place only until August 5, DOD would still have sufficient time to spend all security assistance funds by September 30, 2019.  President Trump, however, would continue the hold long past August 5.   Trump Appointee Took Over Signing Authority from Career Budget Expert  Since becoming Deputy Associate Director for National Security in 2013, Mr. Sandy was responsible for approving release of the funding for programs within his portfolio, including the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.396  Mr. Sandy approved and signed the July 25 funding document.397  On July 29, however, Mr. Duffeya political appointee of President Trump whose prior position had been as Executive Director of the Republican Party of Wisconsintold Mr. Sandya career civil servant with decades of experience in this areathat he would no longer be responsible for approving the release of funding for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.398  Mr. Duffey also revoked the authority for approving the release of funding for 399  Instead, Mr. Duffey would himself assume authority for the $250 million in DOD-administered Ukraine security assistance and authority for approving the release of funding for the $141 million in State Department-administered Foreign Military Financing to Ukraine. 400    Mr. Duffey did not tell Mr. Sandy whether he requested this change in authority but did cting Director and 401  Over the course of several days, Mr. Duffey explained to Mr. Sandy and 402  Mr. Duffe403    Mr. Sandy testified that prior to July 29, he had never heard Mr. Duffey state any interest in approving the release of funding.404  Furthermore, when they learned that Mr. Duffey was taking on this new responsibility, Mr. Sandy and other staff relayed their concerns to Mr. Duffey that it was a substantial workload.405  Mr. Sandy also thought he would learn from apportionments about the accounts as opposed to the other, you 406  Mr. Sandy agreed that there are more efficient ways of learning about accounts and progother materials that I 407    Mr. Sandy was not aware of any prior instance when a political appointee assumed this kind of funding approval authority.40879  After the July 31 interagency meeting at which Ms. Cooper announced that DOD would have to start obligating the funds on or about August 6, Mr. Duffey sought clarification. 409  Ms. Cooper explained to Mr. Duffey that at a certain point DOD would not have sufficient time to fully obligate the funds before they expired at the end of the fiscal year.  In response, Mr. Duffey  410  Ms. Cooper referred Mr. Duffey to the DOD comptroller and to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.411  During the month of August, Mr. Duffey and Ms. McCusker communicated about the implementation of the hold on the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds.412   On August 6 and August 15, Mr. Duffey approved two more funding documents that contained footnotes with language nearly identical to the footnote in the July 25 funding document that initiated the hold; the only difference was that the date funds would become available for spending was changed from August 5 to August 12.413    The August 6 and 15 footnotes, and all subsequent footnotes through September 10, best use of such assistance occurred on July 31.414  Not only was there no active interagency process after July, but Ms. Cooper also was not aware of any review of the funding conducted by DOD in July, August, or September.415  In fact, Ms. Cooper noted that months before, DOD had completed its  in May 2019 that Ukraine had met the requirements to receive funding.416  Similarly, Mr. Kent testified that the State Department did not conduct, and was never asked to conduct, a review of the security assistance funding administered by the State Department.417    footnotes, officials inside OMB were advocating for release of the funds.  On August 7, the National Security Division, International Affairs Division, and Office of Legal Counsel of OMB drafted and transmitted a memo on Ukraine security assistance to OMB Acting Director Vought -418  The National Security nded to remove the hold because (1) the assistance was consistent with the national security strategy in terms of supporting a stable, peaceful Europe; (2) the aid countered Russian aggression; and (3) there was bipartisan support for the program.419  Mr. Duffey approved the memorandum and agreed with the policy recommendation.420    Sometime in mid-August, DOD raised concerns that it might not be able to fully obligate the Defense Department administered funds before the end of the fiscal year.421  Ms. Cooper testified that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency estimated that $100 million of aid might not be obligated in time and was at risk.42280  423   424    Apendency of the holdapproved by Mr. Duffey on August 20, 27, and 31, and September 5, 6, and 10d of the fiscal year.425  Each footnote extended the hold for a period of two to six days.426   potential implications vis-√†-427 and advised Mr. Duffey to 428  Mr. Sandy was copied on emails with the Office of General Counsel on these topics. 429  Although Mr. Sandy understood that the Office of General Counsel supported the footnotes, he noted that there were dissenting opinions within the Office of General Counsel.430  Concerns about whether the Administration was bending, if not breaking, the law by holding back this vital assistance contributed to at least two OMB officials resigning, including one attorney in the Office of General Counsel.431  Mr. Sandy testified that the resignation was motivated in part by concerns about the way OMB was handling the hold on Ukraine security assistance.432  According to Mr. Sandy, the colleague disagreed with the Office of General Counsel about the application of the Impoundment Control Act to the hold on Ukraine security assistance.433   Nevertheless, at the direction of the President, OMB continued to implement the hold through September 11.   Senior Officials Failed to Convince President Trump to Release the Aid in August   Sometime prior to August 16, Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump about the aid.434  According to Mr. Morrison, at that meeting the Presid435  Following the meeting, Ambassador the direct, in-person conversation with the President abo 436   On or about August 13 or 14, Lt. Col. Vindman was directed to draft a Presidential Decision Memorandum for Ambassador Bolton and the other principals to present to President Trump for a decision on Ukraine security assistance.437  The memorandum, finalized on August 15, recommended that the hold should be lifted, explained why, and included the consensus views from the July 26 meeting that the funds should be released.438  Lt. Col. Vindman received conflicting accounts about whether the memorandum was presented to the President.439    recommendation to lift the hold, testified that the memorandum was never provided to the President.440  Mr. Morrison explained that Ambassador Bolton intended to present the memorandum to the President during an unrelated meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, on 441  However, while at Bedminster, the principals 44281  meet with the President but was unable to do so because of scheduling issues.443  According to Mr. Morrison, the next possible opportunity was during a trip to Warsaw, Poland at the beginning of September, but President Trump did not end up making that trip.444    Ms. Cooper recalled receiving an email at the end of August from Secretary of Defense 445   Ukrainian Officials Learned About the Hold in July 2019  hold on security assistance before it was publicly reported in the press on August 28, 2019.  Ms. Croft testified that after July 18when the hold was announced by OMB at the interagency meeting446    Two individuals from the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., approached Ms. ld on 447  Ms. Croft could not precisely recall the dates of these ry early on or much earlier than 448   Ms. Croft explained that the Ukrainian officials came to her quietly because they would not want the hold to become public:   I think that if this were public in Ukraine it would be seen as a reversal of our policy and would, just to say sort of candidly and colloquially, this would be a really big deal, it would be a really big deal in Ukraine, and an expression of declining U.S. support for Ukraine.449    DOD also received questions from the Ukraine Embassy about the status of the military assistance.  Ms. Cooper testified that those occurred on July 25, 2019the same day as President   On July 25th, a member of my staff got a question from a Ukraine Embassy contact asking what was going on with Ukraine security assistance, because at that time, we did not know what the guidance was on USAI [DOD-administered funds].  The OMB notice of apportionment arrived that day, but this staff member did not find out about it until later.  I was informed that the staff member told the Ukrainian official that we were moving forward on USAI, but recommended that the Ukraine Embassy check in with State regarding the FMF [State Department-administered funds].450    On July 25, Ms. Coop45182   staff members reported that sometime during the week of August 6, 452  Ms. Coostaff further reported that Ukrainian officials were aware of the hold on security assistance in August.453      Lt. Col. Vindman testified that, by mid-August, he too was getting questions from Ukrainians about the status of the hold on security assistance:   So to the best of my knowledge, the Ukrainians, first of all, are in general pretty sophisticated, they have their network of, you know, Ukrainian interest groups and so forth.  They have bipartisan support in Congress.  And certainly there areit was no secret, at least within government and official channels, that security assistance was on hold.  And to the best of my recollection, I believe there were some of these light inquires in the mid-August timeframe.454  While numerous individuals, including Ukrainians, were aware of the hold, it did not become publicly known until a Politico report on August 28, 2019.45583  4. the Ukrainian President Was Conditioned on An Announcement of Investigations   President Trump demanded the public announcement by President Zelensky of investigations in the 2016 U.S. election in exchange for an Oval Office meeting.  Trepresentatives made that quid pro quo clear to Ukrainian officials.   Overview  After ordering the hold on security assistance to Ukraine against the unanimous advice of the relevant U.S. government agencies, President Trump used his hand-picked representatives to demand that Ukrainian leaders publicly announce investigations into his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  President Trump, through his agents, made clear that his demand needed to be met before a coveted White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be scheduled.  A face-to-face meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office would have conferred on the new Ukrainian leader much-sought prestige and would have signaled to Russia that Ukraine could continue to count on the support of the President of the United States, which was particularly important as Russia continued to wage war in eastern Ukraine.    To date, the White House meeting for President Zelensky has not occurred.  Following -picked representativesthe so-pressure Ukrainian leaders to announce publicly investigations reelection campaign.  Testimony of multiple witnesses and contemporaneous text messages exchanged between and representatives confirm that the White House meetingand later the release of security assistance for Ukrainewas conditioned on Ukraine .    In the weeks leading up to the July 25 call between President Trump and President epresentatives repeatedly relayed the message of conditionality to Ukrainian government officialsincluding to President Zelensky himselfin meetings in Kyiv, Toronto, and Washington, D.C.  President Zelensky and his advisors struggled to navigate these demandsinvestigations threatened to render U.S. domestic reelection politics.   An Oval Office Meeting for President Zelensky Was Important to Ukraine and U.S. National Security   A face-to-face meeting with the President of the United States in the Oval Office was critical to President Zelensky as the newly-elected Ukrainian leader sought U.S. support for his ambitious anti-corruption agenda and to repel Russian aggression.  A White House meeting was84  also important for U.S. national security because it would have served to bolster negotiating position in peace talks with Russia.  It also would have supported Ukraine as a bulwark against further Russian advances in Europe.    Multiple witnesses unanimously attested to the importance of a White House meeting for Ukraine and the United States.  For example, David Holmes, the Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, 456  Likewise, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent explained that a White House .  He also said that United States to meet with the Ukrainians as they we457  Dr. Fiona Hill, Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director of European and Russian Affairs at the NSC, explained that a White House meeting would supply the new -√†-458  Lt.

The imagery you get from being at the White 461      Ambassador William B. Taylor, Jr. at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on June 17, 2019.  After arriving, Ambassador Taylor worked to secure an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky.  This was agreed-462   Ambassador Taylor worked with Ambassador Volker and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondlandtwo of the Three Amigosto try to schedule this meeting.  Just days after beginning his new position, Ambassador Taylor learned that President Trump hear from Zelensky before scheduling the Oval Office meeting, but Ambassador Taylor did not understand what that meant at the time.463  On June 27, Ambassador Sondland informed Ambassador Taylor that President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not 464  Ambassador Taylor relayed this conversation to Mr. Holmes, who testified that he understood context to mean -Biden investigations that Mr. Giuliani and his associates had been  publicly.46585   On June 28, Secretary of Energy Rick Perrythe third of the Three Amigosand Ambassadors Sondland, Volker, and Taylor participated in a conference call to prepare for a discussion later that day with President Zelensky.  During this preparatory call, Ambassador Volker explained that -on-one meeting in Toronto, Canada.  Specifically, Ambassador Volker intended to inform President Zelensky that President Trump would require Ukraine to rule of law, transparency, but also, specifically, cooperation on investigations to get to the bottom of things466    For the subsequent call with President Zelensky on June 28, Ambassador Sondland sought to limit the number of U.S. government personnel listening in.  According to Ambassador interagency participants and monitoring.  Ambassador Taylor testified that he considered  467  During that call, President Zelensky and the U.S. officials discussed energy policy and the conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine.  The Ukrainian president also noted that he looked forward to the White House visit that President Trump had offered in a letter dated May 29.468  The exclusion of State Department staff and notetakers from the June 28 call was an early indication to Ambassador Taylor that separate channels of diplomacy related to Ukraine policyan official channel and an irregular channelwer.  Ambassador Taylor testified:  This suggested to me that there were the two channels.  This suggested to me that the normal channel, where you would have staff on the phone call, was being cut out, and the other channel, of people who were working, again, toward a goal which I supported, which was having a meeting to further U.S.-Ukrainian relations, I supported, but that participate in this call with the head of state.469    Given Ambassador SondlandZelensky, Ambassador Taylor asked Ambassadors Sondland and Volker by text message how they planned to handle informing other U.S. officials about the contents of the call.  Ambassador Volker responded:  to try to build working relationship 470  Ambassador Sondland then texted:  471  Nevertheless, Ambassador Taylor informed Mr. Kent about the call and wrote a memo for the record dated June 30 that summarized the conversation with President Zelensky.472   in Toronto  On July 2, Ambassador Volker met with President Zelensky and his chief of staff on the sidelines of the Ukraine Reform Conference in Toronto.

As discussed further in Chapter 5, during the July 25 call, President Zelensky expressed his openness to pursuing investigations into President Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  President Zelensky also specifically   Ambassadors Volker and Sondland Worked to Get Mr. Giuliani What He Needed  According to Ambassador Sondland, Pa public announcement about investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election was a  for the White House meeting.479  In fact, Ambassador Sondland testified that the announcement of the investigationsand not the investigations themselveswas the price President Trump sought in exchange for a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Zelensky:  Q:   But he had to get those two investigations if that official act was going to take place, correct?   A: He had to announce the investigations.  He didn't actually have to do them, as I understood it.   Q:   Okay.  President Zelensky had to announce the two investigations the President wanted, make a public announcement, correct?   A: Correct.480    Ambassadors Sondland and Volker understood that they needed to work with Mr. Giuliani, who was publicly pressing for the announcement of investigations that would benefit President Trump politically.  As discussed in Chapter 2, Ambassador Sondland testified that the key to overcoming  was personal attorney.  Sondland said, faced with a choice:  We could abandon the efforts to schedule the White House phone call and a87  White House visit481    Ambassador Volker discussed his intention to contact Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Kent.  Ambassador Volker explained that he intended to reach out to Mr. Giuliani because it was clear 482  Ukrainian officials also understood the importance of working through Mr. Giuliani, something that was underscored by his successful effort to smear and remove Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from Kyiv in late April.483     Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Kent raised concerns about President needs to investigate Biden and the 2016 campaalso warned 484  On July 10, Ambassador Taylor met with Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, before their Ukrainian colleagues were scheduled to meet with National Security Advisor John Bolton at the White House later that day.  At the meeting in Kyiv, the Ukrainian officials expressed that they who had learned from Mr. Giuliani, that President Trump had decided not to meet with President Zelensky.485    Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassador Volker to explain the situation and advised that he had also informed T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, Counselor of the Department of State:     Volker: Good grief.  Please tell Vadym to let the official USG representatives speak for the U.S. lutsenko has his own self- Taylor:   Exactly what I told them. Taylor:   And I said that RG is a private citizen. Taylor:   I briefed Ulrich this afternoon on this.486  Despite his text message to Ambassador Taylor that official U.S. government representatives should be allowed to , warnings about engaging with Mr. Giuliani, Ambassador Volker almost immediately reached out to Mr. Giuliani.  Four minutes after sending the text message above, Ambassador Volker texted 487     One hour later, around 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, Ambassador Volker met Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak for coffee at the Trump Hotel before they traveled down Pennsylvania Avenue to their afternoon meetings at the White House.488  Over coffee, Mr. Yermak asked Ambassador Volker to connect him to Mr. Giuliani, thus further demonstrating they wanted from President Trump, namely the Oval Office meeting.48988   July 10 White House Meetings:  Ambassador Sondland  Explicitly Communicated  to Ukrainians  On July 10, during two separate meetings at the White House, Ambassador Sondland informed senior Ukrainian officials that there was a pbefore an Oval Office meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky would be scheduled.490      The first meeting took place  responsible for UkraineDr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindmanattended, as did the Three Amigos:  Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and Ambassador Volker.  The Ukrainian delegation included Mr. Yermak, a senior aide to President Zelensky, and Oleksandr  the incoming Ukrainian National Security Advisor.491  The purpose of the meeting was twofold.  The Ukrainians were seeking advice and assistance from Ambassador nxious to set up a meeting, a first meeting between President Zelensky and our President.492  Near the end of the meeting, the Ukrainian officials raised the scheduling of the Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky.  According to Dr. Hill, blurted out:  Well, we have an agreement with the [White House] Chief of SDr. Hill described that others in the room looked up from their notes, thinking the comment was recounted that Ambassador Bolton was polite but was very abrupt.  I mean, he looked at the clock as if he had, you know, suddenly another meeting and his time was up, but it was obvious he ended the meeting, she added.493    Lt. Col. Vindman similarly testified that the meeting  proceeded well until Ukrainian officials raised the meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky.  The Ukrainians stated that they considered the Oval Office meeting to be pamentioned Ukraine delivering specific investigations in 494  Although Ambassador Volker did not recall any mention of July 10 meeting at his deposition,495 he later testified at his public hearing, meeting  was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations496  After Ambassador Bolton ended the meeting in his office, Ambassador Sondland Ukrainians, Ambassador Volker, Secretary Perry, and others to go to a second meeting in the Ward Room of the White House, located near the secure spaces of the White House Situation Room.  As Dr. Hill described it, the purpose of the Ward Room meeting was89  Ukrainians about next steps meeting for President Zelensky.497  As Dr. Hill was leaving , he pulled her aside and directed her to attend the Ward Room meeting report to him.  Dr. Hill followed his instruction.498  During the Ward Room meeting, which occurred after a brief photo opportunity outside the West Wing, Ambassador Sondland was more explicit in pressing the Ukrainians to undertake the investigations in order to secure an Oval Office meeting for President Zelensky.  Lt. Col. Vindman testified that when the group entered the Ward Room, Ambassador Sondland began to ion of  also mentioned Burisma.499  Dr. Hill entered the Ward Room as the discussion was underway.  She testified that Ambassador Sondland, in front of the Ukrainians, as I came in, was talking about how he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the Ukrainians if they were going to go forward with investigations.  And my director for Ukraine [Lt. Col. Vindman] was looking completely alarmed.500  Dr. Hill recalled that Ambassador Sondland mentioned in the presence of the Ukrainians, in response to which Mr. Danyliuk also appeared and as if he did not know what was happening.501    Dr. Hill confronted Ambassador Sondland, informing him that Ambassador Bolton had sent her there to ensure that the U.S. officials did not commit to a meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky.  Ambassador Sondland responded that he and the Ukrainians already had an agreement that the meeting would go forward.502  At however, Ambassador Sondland excused the Ukrainian officials, who moved into the corridor near the White House Situation Room.    Dr. Hill then told Ambassador Sondland:  Ambassador Bolton wants to make it very clear that we have to talk about, you know, how are we going to set up this meeting.  Lt. Col. Vindman relayed his own concerns to Ambassador Sondland in the Ward Room.503  He explained that the request to investigate the Bidens and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that 504  Ambassador Sondland responded that he had had conversations with Mr. Mulvaney and he also mentioned Mr. Giuliani.  Lt. Col. Vindman confirmed that Ambassador Sondland described an agreement he had with Mr. Mulvaney about the Oval Office meeting:  I heard him say that this had been coordinated with White just said that he had had a conversation with Mr. Mulvaney, and this is what was required in 505  Dr. Hill then cut the conversation short because she get further into annoyed with this, but then, you know, 50690  Later on July 10, when Ambassador Taylor asked Ambassador Volker how the meetings went with the Ukrainian officials and whether they had resulted in a decision on a presidential call, Ambassador Volker replied:  507    Following the July 10 White House meetings, Mr. Yermak followed up with Ambassador Volker by text message:  Thank you for meeting and your clear and very logical position.  Will be great meet with you before my departure and discuss.  I feel that the key for many things is 508  Concerned Officials Reported Details of This    relayed what she had just witnessedreport the conversation to John Eisenberg, Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and the Legal Advisor to the National Security Council:  And he told me, and this is a direct quote from Ambassador Bolton:  You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking 509   Dr. Hill explained red to Ambassador Sondland and Mr. conditioning of a White House meeting on investigations.510  By this point, Dr. Hill explained, it was clear that investigations were code, at least, for Burisma.  Because that had been mentioned, you know, in th511  Numerous U.S. officials, including Ambassadors Sondland, Volker, and Bolton, as well as Lt. these political investigations.  Following the meeting with Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill reported what had occurred to Mr. Eisenberg.  She conveyed to Mr. Eisenberg the details of the two meetings, including agreement with Mr. Mulvaney to provide the White House meeting if Ukraine agreed to pursue the investigations.512  The initial conversation between Dr. Hill and Mr. Eisenberg was brief, and they scheduled a longer discussion for the next day.513    On July 11, Dr. Hill enlisted another NSC official who attended the July 10 meetings, Senior Director for International Energy and Environment P. Wells Griffith, to attend the longer discussion with Mr. Eisenberg.514  Dr. Hill and Mr. Griffith went over the events of July 10 and further explained that Ambassador Sondland said that he had been communicating with Mr. Giuliani.  Mr. Eisenberg was and stated that he would follow up.  Dr. Hill specifically, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.515     Lt. Col. Vindman separately reported his concerns about the July 10 meetings to Mr. Eisenberg.  He told Mr. Eisenberg that Ambassador Sondland had asked for investigations into 516  Lt. Col. Vindman also reported that the  a, you know, national91  517  Mr. Eisenberg said that he would look into it and invited Lt. Col. Vindman to return if any further concerns arose.  No one from the of the White House Counselhowever, followed up with Lt. Col. Vindman on this issue.518    Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman discussed their reactions and alarm about the July 10 discussions with each other.  They both believed ,and that they would not get involved with the scheme.519  On July 19, they also shared their concerns about Ambassador Ambassador Taylor.520  Ambassador Sondland Coached President Zelensky on Investigations and  Ke  In mid-July, Dr. Hill was preparing to depart the NSC and transitioning her role to Timothy Morrison, who had been serving in another role at the NSC.521  On July 13, Ambassador Sondland emailed [s]unbundling moving forward and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transpar, Oval.  522  Later that evening, Mr. Morrison 523    On July 19, a little over a week after the July 10 meetings at the White House, Ambassador Sondland spoke directly to President Zelensky about the upcoming call between the two presidents:  he wanted thissome kind of a 524     Following his call with President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland emailed several senior Trump Administration officials, including Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Secretary Perry, and their staffs.  The subject line of the July 19 email read:  Zelensky just now. Ambassador Sondland wrote:   Will assure him that he intends to run a fully call prior to Sunday so that he can put out 525   Secretary Perry 526 and Mr. Mulvaney also responded to confirm that he had asked the NSC to set up the call between the presidents for the following day, July 20.527    Ambassador Sondland explained that this email chain showed that [e]veryone was in the  regarding his discussions with Ukrainian officials about the need for the Ukrainian leader to confirm to President Trump that he would announce the investigations.  As Ambassador Sondland further testified:92  It was no secret.  Everyone was informed via email on July 19th, days before the Presidential call.  As I communicated to the team, I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to run a fully transparent investigation and turn over every stone were necessary in his call with President Trump.528    Call records reviewed by the Committees show repeated contact between Ambassador Sondland and the White House around this time.  For example, on July 19, at 10:43 a.m. Eastern Time, a number associated with the White House dialed Ambassador Sondland.  Four minutes later, at 10:47 a.m., Ambassador Sondland called a White House phone number and connected for approximately seven minutes.529    Later in the afternoon of July 19, Ambassador Sondland texted Ambassadors Volker and Taylor:    I spike [sic] directly to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing.  530  Good. Had breakfast with Rudy this morningteeing up call w Yermak Monday.  Must have helped.  Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigationand address any specific personnel issuesif there are any531    Mr. Giuliani Met with State Department Officials and Ukrainian Government Officials   As Ambassador Volker informed Ambassador Sondland in the above text message, on July 19, Ambassador Volker met Mr. Giuliani and his now-indicted associate Lev Parnas for breakfast at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.532  Ambassador Volker also texted Mr. Yermak to inform him that he and Mr. Giuliani were meeting that dayanticipated breakfast today533  During the breakfast, Mr. Giuliani and Ambassador Volker discussed the discredited allegations against former Vice President Biden relating to Ukraine.  Ambassador Volker testified that he pushed back against the allegations during his breakfast with Mr. Giuliani:  One of the things that I said in that breakfast that I had with Mr. Giuliani, the only time Vice President Biden was ever discussed with me, and he was repeatingmaking an but he was repeating all of the things that were in the media that we talked about earlier about, you know, firing the prosecutor general and his son being on the company and all that.   And I said to Rudy in that breakfast the first time we sat down to talk that it is simply not credible to me that Joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as Vice President by money or things for his son or anything like that.  person of 534   Ambassador Volker further advised Mr. Giuliani during the breakfast that the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General, Yuriy Lutsenko, -serving narrative to preserve himself in power. Mr. Giuliani agreed with Ambassador Volker and stated that he had come to that conclusion as well.53593  Following the breakfast, Ambassador Volker connected Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Yermak by text message:    Volker:  Mr Mayor  really enjoyed breakfast this morning. As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.  I suggest we schedule a call together on Monday  maybe 10am or 11am Washington time?  Kurt  Giuliani:  Monday 10 to 11  Yermak:   Ok, thank you  Volker:   I will set up call  10 am  thanks  Kurt  Yermak:  536  On the morning of July 22, Mr. Yermak texted Ambassador Volker about the upcoming call with Mr. Giulianivery good that their discussion would take place before the call between President Trump and President Zelensky.537  Later that day, the three men spoke by phone.  Ambassador Volker described the July 22 discussion as merely an ,538 although phone records indicate that the call lasted for approximately 38 minutes.539    Ambassador Volker testified that during the call, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak discussed plans for an in-person meeting in Madrid in early August.540  Afterward, Ambassador Volker texted Mr. Yermak that he thought the call Yermak send Mr. Giuliani a text message to schedule a date for the Madrid meeting.541  Mr. Yermak texted and to meet in person as soon as possible.542  Later on July [o]is now advocating for phone callan apparent reference to the call between President Trump and President Zelensky that would occur on July 25.  Ambassador Volker also recommended that Ambassador Sondland inform Mr. Mulvaney ,and that he planned to convey the same information to Ambassador Bolton.  Ambassador Sondland replied that Mr. Morrison of the White House NSC was also in support of the call.543  Ambassador Volker also told Ambassador Sondland that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak would meet in person in Madrid within a couple of weeks.544  President Zelensky Feared Reelection Campaign  Around this time, senior Ukrainian officials informed U.S. officials that the new Ukrainian president did not want Ukraine to become enmeshed in U.S. domestic reelection politics.94  On July 20, Ambassador Taylor spoke with Mr. Danyliuk, the Ukrainian national security advisor, who conveyed that President Zelensky did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S.  545  Ambassador Taylor discussed  with Ambassador Volker and, the next day, texted Ambassador Sondland:  Taylor:  Gordon, one thpoint that President Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.  Sondland:  Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext.  I am worried about the alternative.546   547  According to Ambassador Taylor, President Zelensky understood what President Trump and Mr. Giuliani meant by investigations he Ukrainians understood that the investigations were pursuant to Mr. develop information, to find information about Burisma and the Bidens.  This was very well known in public.  Mr. Giuliani had made this point clear in several instances in the beginningin the springtim548  Ambassador Taylor also testified that the to be 549    Despite the Ukrainian resistance, Ambassador Sondland said he believed that the public President Trump.  When message to Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Sondland explainedagreed-upon interview or the agreed-upon press statement.  We just need to get by it so that the 550    Witnesses Confirmed the President Conditioned an Oval Office Meeting on Investigations  Multiple witnesses testified that the conditioning of an Oval Office meeting on President from the very top:  President Trump.    Ambassador Sondland testified that he, Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Volker worked with Mr. 551  Ambassador Sondland stated 552  Ambassador Sondland explained 55395  Ambassador Sondland further testified that President Trump expressedboth directly and through Mr. Giulianithat he wanted 554  Ambassador Sondland explained:  I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question:  Was there a quid pro quo?  As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.555    Ambassador Sondland also testified that knowledge of this quid pro quo was widespread that President Zelensky had to announce these specific investigations to secure an Oval Office meeting.  As an example, Ambassador Sondland cited an emailcopying Senior Advisor to the White House Chief of Staff Robert Blair, State Department Executive Secretary Lisa Kenna, Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Energy Brian McCormack, Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary Perry, and Secretary Pompeo556   Other U.S. government officials also understood this scheme as a quid pro quo.  Ambassador Taylor testified that as early as mid-meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on investigations of Burisma and alleged 557  Mr. Holmes similarly understood that by July558  Dr. Hill testified that this quid pro quo was readily apparent after reading the July 25 call summary, explaining that it revealed that the White .559  Final Preparation for Trump-Zelensky Call:  Ambassador Volker Counseled Ukrainians and  Ambassador Sondland Prepped President Trump  Ambassador Taylor testified that the call between President Trump and President Zelensky that ultimately occurred on July 25 was not confirmed until the last minute:  trying to schedule it for about a week in advance, that whole week.  As I say, back and forth, yes, 560  According to Ambassador Taylor, at least one person had prescient concerns about the call before it occurred:  did not want to have the call because he thought it was going to be a disaster.  He thought that there could be some talk of investigations or worse on th561    Before the call took place on July 25, Ambassador Volker had lunch with Mr. Yermak in Kyiv.  Ambassador Volker followed up with a text message to Mr. Yermak approximately 30 minutes before the call, noting that a White House visit was still on the table if, during the call,96   Volker:   Good lunch  thanks. Heard from White Houseassuming President Z convinces trump he   Good luck! See you tomorrow - kurt  Ambassador Volker later informed Ambassador Sondland that he had relayed this earlier that day:  Volker:  Hi Gordon - got your message.  Had a great lunch w Yermak and then passed your message to him.  He will see you tomorrow.  Think everything in place562  Ambassador Sondland testified that that Ambassador Volker conveyed to Mr. Yermak in advance of the July 25 call likely originated from an earlier conversation that Ambassador Sondland had with President Trump:  Q: So is it fair to say that this message is what you received from President Trump on that phone call that morning?   A:  Again, if he testified to that, to refresh my own memory, then, yes, likely I would have received that from President Trump.  Q: But the sequence certainly makes sense, right?   A: Yeah, it does.   Q: You talked to President Trump.   A: Yeah. Q: You told Kurt Volker to call you.  You left a message for Kurt Volker.  Kurt Volker sent this text message to Andriy Yermak to prepare President Zelensky and then President Trump had a phone call where President Zelensky spoke very similar to what was in this text message, right?   A: Right.   Q: And you would agree that the message in thisthat is expressed here is that President Zelensky needs to convince Trump that he will do the investigations in order to nail down the date for a visit to Washington, D.C.  Is that correct?   A: Thas correct.563    Ambassador Sondland testified that he spoke with President Trump before the call with President Zelensky.564  Mr. Morrison also confirmed that President Trump and Ambassador Sondland .565  Mr. Morrison stated 566  According to Mr. Morrison, Ambassador Sondlfacilitate the July 25 call between President Trump and President Zelensky.567  On July 26, the day after the call between President Trump and President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker acknowledged his role in prepping President Zelensky for the call with97  President Trump in a text to Mr. Giuliani:   you may have heardthe President has [sic] a great phone call with the Ukrainian President yesterday.  Exactly the right messages 56898  5. The President Asked the Ukrainian President to Interfere in the 2020 U.S. Election by Investigating the Bidens and 2016 Election Interference   stigate his political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  The next day, gonna do th   Overview  During a telephone call on July 25, 2019, President Donald J. Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joseph Biden, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.  President Trump also discussed the removal of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. some things that they immediately reported the details of the call to senior White House lawyers.  When asked by a reporter on October 3, 2019, what he had hoped President Zelensky  they were   President Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election have been discredited.  The witnesses reaffirmed that in late 2015 and early 2016, when former Vice President Biden advocated for the removal of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, he acted in -ial policy of the United States, the European Union, and major international financial institutions.  Witnesses also unanimously testified that the removal of that prosecutor made it more likely that Ukraine would investigate corruption, not less likely.  Dr. Fiona Hill, former Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for European and Russian Affairs at the National Security Council, testified that the conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election touted by President Trump are a Advisor Tom Bossert and former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster repeatedly advised the President that the so-called     Nonetheless, on July 26, 2019, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland met with senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv and then informed President Trump that99  alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  Ambassador Sondland added that Ambassador Sondland told David Holmes, Counselor for Political Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, that Preside    On July 25, 2019, President Zelensky finally had a long-awaited phone call with   It had been over three months since the two leaders first spoke.  Despite a warm but largely non-substantive call on April 21, President Trump had since declined President attend either.569  Ukrainian efforts to set a date for a promised Oval Office meeting with President Trump were stalled.  As Mr. Holmes explained, following the April 21 call:   President Zelensky and senior members of his team made clear that they wanted American support, and requested a call with President Trump as soon as possible.570    Before scheduling the July 25 call or a White House visit, President Trump met on June 28 with Russian President Vladimir Putinwhose armed forces were engaged in a war of attrition against U.S.-backed Ukrainian forceson the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.571  During their meeting, President Trump and President Putin shared a joke about 572    On July 25, President Trump joined the call with President Zelensky from the Executive Residence at the White House, away from a small group of senior national security aides who would normally join him in the Oval Office for a conversation with a foreign head of state.  President Trump and President Zelensky began to speak at 9:03 a.m. Washington time4:03 p.m. in Kyiv.  According to Tim Morrison, the newly-installed Senior Director for Europe and 573  Translators interpreted the call on both sides.574  American aides listening to the call from the White House Situation Room hoped that what was said over the next 30 minutes would provide President Zelensky with the strong U.S. endorsement he needed in order to successfully negotiate an end to the five-year-old war with Russia that had killed over 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers and to advance President Zelens-corruption initiatives in Ukraine.575  -matter experts, NSC Director for Ukraine Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Mr. Morrison, were both on the call.576  They had prepared talking points for President Trump and were taking detailed notes of what both leaders said, so that they could promptly implement any agreed-upon actions.577  They were joined by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia.  Assistant to the President Robert Blair, a100  senior aide to Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, was also present, along with an NSC press officer.578  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listened from a different location, as did Dr. Charles M. Kupperman, the Deputy National Security Advisor.579    Notably, Secretary Pompeo did not reveal that he listened to the July 25 call when asked directly about it on This Week on September 22.580  Neither Secretary Pompeo nor the State 581  The two presidents first exchanged pleasantries.  President Trump congratulated the  582    The discussion turned to U.S. support for Ukraine.  President Trump contrasted U.S.  effort and a lot of time.  Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to 583  President Zelensky, whose government receives billions of dollars in financial support from the European Union and against Russia.584   585   President Zelensky then raised the issue of U.S. military assistance for Ukraine with support in the area of an area where U.S. support is vital.586  President Zelensky continued:  to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purpose587   The Javelin anti-tank missiles, first transferred to Ukraine by the United States in 2018, were widely viewed by U.S. officials as a deterrent against further Russian encroachment into Ukrainian territory.588  Immediately after the Ukrainian leader raised the issue of U.S. military assistance to 589101  Request to Investigate 2016 Election  requested that Ukraine investigate a discredited conspiracy theory aimed at undercutting the U.S. ment interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.590  Specifically, President Trump stated:  I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike...  I guess you have one of your wealthy people...  The server, they say surrounding yourself with some of the same people.  I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.  As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine.  591  President Trump was referencing the widely debunked conspiracy theory that the Ukrainian governmentand not Russiawas behind the hack of Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers in 2016, and that the American cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Russian government.592    For example, during a press conference in February 2017, just weeks after the U.S. Intelligence Community unanimously assessed in a public report that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election to benefit the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, President Putin falsely asserted the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral position in favour of one candidate.  More than that, certain oligarchs, certainly with the approval of the political leadership, funded this 593  uly Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.  Dr. Hill, an expert on Russia aits security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow by 594    Advisor, stated publicly that 595  Dr. Hill testified that White House officialsincluding Mr. Bossert and former National Security Advisor H.R.

President Trump told President Zelensky:  prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.  Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it...  It sounds horrible to me.601  going to have Attorney General Barr call and we w602  603  When President Trump asserted to President Zelensky during the July 25 call that former Trump103  former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.    Multiple witnessesincluding Dr. Hill, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Mr. Holmes, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kenttestified that they were not aware of any credible evidence to support the claim that former Vice President Biden acted inappropriately when he advocated for the removal of Mr. Shokin.604  To the contrary, those witnesses confirmed that it was the official policy of the United States, the - typical Ukraine prosecutor who lived a lifestyle far in excess of his government salary, who 605  Mr. Kent further explained:  What former Vice President Biden requested of former President of Ukraine Poroshenko was the removal of a corrupt prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who had undermined a program of assistance that we had spent, again, U.S. taxpayer money to try to build an independent investigator unit to go after corrupt prosecutors.606  As Ambassador Yovanovitch testified, the removal of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor general, who was not prosecuting enough corruption, increased the chance that alleged corruption in companies in Ukraine could be investigated.607  Mr. Shokin was a known associate of Mr. Giuliani.  As described in Chapter 1, Mr. Giuliani had been communicating with Mr. Shokin since at least 2018.608  Mr. Giuliani also lobbied the White House on behalf of Mr. Shokin to intervene earlier in 2019 when the State Department rejected a visa application for Mr. Shokin to visit the United States based upon Mr. 609  Ambassador Kurt Volker, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, testified that he explicitly warned Mr. Giulianito no availagainst duties as Vice President by 610  Ambassador Volker affirmed that former 611  Attacks Against Ambassador Yovanovitch  During the July 25 call, President Trump also attacked Ambassador Yovanovitch, whom he had ousted as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine three months earlier after a concerted smear campaign perpetuated by Mr. Giuliani.  As described in Chapter 1, Mr. Giuliani viewed Ambassador Yovanovitcha decorated diplomat who had championed Ukrainian anti-corruption officials and activistsas an impediment to his activities in Ukraine.612  President Trump told President Zelensky:  was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want :  613  Ambassador Yovanovitch described her visceral reaction when she first read the call record, after the White House released it104  shocked.  I mean, I was very surprised that President Trump wouldfirst of all, that I would feature repeatedly in a Presidential phone call, but secondly, that the President would speak about me or an614  When asked whether she Ambassador Yovanovitch answered that she did.615  Praise of Corrupt Former Ukrainian Prosecutor  After disparaging Ambassador Yovanovitch, who had an extensive record of combatting corruption, President Trump praised an unnamed former Ukrainian prosecutor generalreferring to Yuriy Lutsenkowho was widely considered to be corrupt and had promoted false allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch.616  President Trump told President Zelensky:  A lot of people are talking about that, the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and 617  I heard the prosecutor was treated 618  At the time of the July 25 call, Mr. Lutsenkowho was collaborating with Mr. Giuliani to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch and the Bidenswas still the Ukrainian prosecutor general.  promised reforms that he had committed to when he took office, and he was using his office to 619  By July 2019, Mr. Holmes assessed that  Zelensky 620  Multiple witnesses testified that another former Ukrainian prosecutor, Mr. Shokin, was also considered to be corrupt.  For example, Mr. Kent testified during his deposition that Mr. information in order to extract revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct, including U.S. diplomats, Ukrainian anticorruption officials, and reform-minded civil society 621  Ambassador Volker testified at his public hearing that Mr. Lutsenko was in a self-622  Mr. Holmes further noted that Mr. 623   After the call, the White House press office issued a short and incomplete summary of the call, omitting major elements of the conversation.  The press statement read:   Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to congratulate him on his recent election.  President Trump and President Zelenskyy discussed ways to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and economic cooperation.  Both leaders also expressed that they look forward to the opportunity to meet.624105  Concerns Raised by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman  prepareda call briefing package, including talking 625  The NSC-drafted talking points did not include any reference to Biden, Burisma, CrowdStrike, or alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.626  Lt.

Vindman testified during his deposition that, prior to the July 25 call, he was aware of concerns from former National Security Advisor John Bolton and other U.S. officials that President Trump might raise these discredited issues with President Zelensky.627  Indeed, Ambassador Bolton had resisted scheduling the call because he believed it might be a 628    As he sat in the White House Situation Room listening to the leaders, Lt. Col. Vindman 629630  Lt. Col. Vindman knew immediately that he had a duty to report the contents of the call erns, and it was my duty to report my concerns to the proper631  Lt. Col. Vindman testified investigation into his U.S. politito meet in order to secure a White House meeting:  So, Congressman, the power disparity between the President of the United States and the President of Ukraine is vast, and, you know, in the President asking for something, it becamethere wasabout.  This was about getting a White House meeting.  It was a demand for him to fulfill hisfulfill this particular prerequisite in order to get the meeting.632    Chairman, as I said in my statement, it was inappropriate.  It was improper for the President to requestto demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially a impartial investigation, and that this would have significant implications if it became public knowledge, and it would be perceived as a partisan play.  It would undermine our Ukraine policy, and it would undermine our national security.633  Within an hour of the call ending, Lt. Col. Vindman reported his concerns to John A. Eisenberg, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and the Legal106  Advisor to the NSC , and Michael Ellis, a Senior Associate Counsel to the President and the Deputy Legal Advisor to the NSC.634  Lt. Col. Vindman recounted the content of the call based Trump to ask President Zelensky to investigate Vice President Biden.635  Concerns Raised by Timothy Morrison  After 17 years as a Republican Congressional staffer and approximately a year serving Europe and Russia all with President Zelensky.636    Before he transitioned into his new role, Mr. Morrison met with his predecessor, Dr. Hill.  She advised him to stay away from efforts orchestrated by Mr. Giuliani and Ambassador Sondland to pressure Ukraine into investigati 637  Dr. Hill also warned Mr. Morrison before the election related to the DNC server.638    Mr. Morrison testified that he had no knowledge of any investigations at the time, but 639  Even though he was new to the portfolio, Mr. Morrison promptly concluded that 640  Mr. Morrison further explained that he tried to stay away from requests related to Burisma and was 641  ull-throated endorsement of the 642  and Mr. Ellis, the NSC lawyers.  He asked them to review the call, which he feared would be 643  644   645  During his deposition, however, Mr. on the call.646  In a second meeting with Mr. Eisenberg, Mr. Morrison requested that access to the electronic files of the call record be restricted.  This was an unusual request.  Mr. Morrison confirmed to the Committee that he had never before asked the NSC Legal Advisor to restrict access to a presidential call record.647  It was also unusual because Mr. Morrison raised107  restricting access with Mr. Eisenberg despite the fact that Mr. Morrison himself had the authority, as an Executive Secretariat.    Lt. Col. Vindman also discussed restricting access to the July 25 call summary with Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Ellis.  At some point after the call, Lt. Col. Vindman discussed with the NSC 648  Lt. Col. Vindman explai649  But the July 25 call was particularly  650  651  Lt. Col. Vindman recalled that Mr. Ellis raised the idea of placing the call summary on the -652  Some weeks after his discussions with the NSC attorneys, Mr. Morrison could not locate the call record.  He contacted the staff of the 653  This transfer occurred ew that the call record did not meet the requirements to be placed on the highly classified system.654    Mr. Eisenberg later told Mr. Morrison that the call record had been placed on the highly 655  Even after Mr. Eisenberg stated that the call record was at least the third week of September 2019, shortly before its declassification and public release by the White House.656  Concerns Raised by Jennifer Williams  between President Trump and other heads of state prior to July 25, 2019, as well as Vice President 657  As she sat listening to President 658    that the former Vice President is a political opponent of t659  The comments struck 660  had heard internally the President reference particular investigations that previously I had only 661108  Significantly, Ms. Williams, who had learned about the hold on security assistance for Ukraine on July 3, also said that the Trump-662    Mr. Morrison, Lt. Col. Vindman, and Ms. Williams all agreed that the publicly released record of the call was substantially accurate, but Lt. Col. Vindman and Ms. Williams both in the call record.  Specifically, Lt. Col. Vindman testified that his notes indicated President when 663  er in the call when referring to a 664  aine would not necessarily know anything about this company some of these elements because the story had been developing for some time, but the fact that he mentioned specif665  The Substance of the Call Remained Tightly Controlled  Ms. Williams testified that staff in the Office of the Vice President placed the draft call ightly briefing book on July 25.666  Separately, and following established protocols for coordinating U.S. government activities toward Ukraine, Lt. Col. Vindman provided Mr. Kent at the State Department with a readout.  Because Mr. Kent had worked on Ukraine policy for many years, Lt. Col. Vindman note of the fact that there 667  Recalling this conversation, t 668    Soon after arriving in Kyiv from Brussels on July 25, Ambassador Sondland asked the U.S. Embassy to arrange a meeting the next day with Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermak.669  On the morning of July 26, Ambassadors Sondland, Volker and Tayloraccompanied by Mr. Holmes, who acted as their official notetakerwent to the Presidential Administration109  Building in central Kyiv for meetings with Ukrainian officials.670  Contrary to standard procedure, Mr. Holmes and Ambassador Taylor did not receive readouts of the July 25 call, so they were unaware of what President Trump and President Zelensky had discussed.671  Ambassador Volker also did not receive an official readout of the July 25 call from the NSC staff.  He testified that Andriy Yermak, a senior aide to President Zelensky, simply characterized 672    The first meeting on July 26 was with Chief of Staff to President Zelensky Andriy Bohdan.673  674  Mr. Holmes further testified that Mr. Bohdan then 675  anscript that I realized that the 676  Subsequently, Ambassadors Sondland, Taylor, and Volker met with President Zelensky and other senior officials.

Although she did not attend the meeting with President Zelensky, she received a readout from Ambassadors Volker and Taylor later that day, as they were traveling in an embassy vehicle.  Ms. Croft te680  Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor told the Committee that they did not recall President 681  Ambassador Volker similarly did not recall that the issue of investigations was discussed, but testified that he did not dispute the validity of 682    Ambassador Sondland Met One-on-One with Ukrainian Presidential Aide  The meeting with President Zelensky ended around noon.683  After the meeting, Ambassadors Taylor and Volker departed the Presidential Administration building for a visit to the front lines of the war with Russia in eastern Ukraine.684  Ambassador Sondland separately instruction from his leadership at the U.S. Embassy to join Ambassador Sondland.685  By that point, Mwas a flight of stairs behind Ambassador Sondland as he headed 686  687  Mr. Holmes then ned to110  and strongly urged her to let me in, but she told me that Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak had insisted that the meeting be one on one with no note take688  689  690  When it ended, Ambassador Sondland did not provide Mr. Holmes an explanation of what they discussed.691  as probably a part 692    Call Between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland on July 26, 2019  After a busy morning of meetings with Ukrainian officials on July 26, Ambassador Sondland indicated that he wanted to get lunch.  Mr. 693  Ambassador Sondland accepted the off694  695  y social.  Ambassador Sondland selected a bottle of wine that he shared among the four of us, and we discussed topics such as 696  Later during the meal, Ambassador Sondland 697  Ambassador Sondland then placed a call on his unsecure mobile phone.  Mr. Holmes was taken aback.

I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine.  Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine, and went on to state that President do 701  President Trump has denied that he spoke to Ambassador Sondland on July 26 and told 702  But in his public testimony before the Committee, Ambassador Sondland noted that White House call records made available to his legal counsel confirmed that the July 26 call in fact occurred.703  Ambassador Sondland further explained that Mrefreshed his recollection about the July 26 call, which Ambassador Sondland had not originally disclosed to the Committee.704    Although Ambassador Sondland did not believe he mentioned the Bidens by name, he 705  He 706  Asked about his stateTrump and I communicate, a lot of four-707  After the call between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump ended, Ambassador 708  Mr. Holmes, who had learned about the freeze on U.S. security opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland fo  In particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the President did not give a shit about Ukraine.

And Ambassador Sondland replied that he  Giuliani was pushing.

Mr. Holmes then returned to the U.S. Embassy.712  Ambassador Taylor, the acting Ambassador in Kyiv, was still visiting the front line.  So when he arrived at the Embassy, Mr. Holmes briefed his immediate supervisor, Kristina Kvien, Deputy Chief of Mission at U.S. ne.713    After taking a long-planned vacation from July 27 to August 5, Mr. Holmes told Ambassador Taylor about his lunch with Ambassador Sondland on the first day he returned to work, August 6.714  Mr. Holmes told the Committee that he did not brief the call in detail to   ding agreement.  So did I go through every single word in the call?  No, because everyone by that point agreed, it was obvious what the President was pressing for.715    In October 2019, following the public release of testimony by several witnesses pursuant preparing to return to Washington and testify publicly before the Committee.  Mr. Holmes had been following news coverage of the inquiry and realized he had unique, firsthand evidence that efforts to press the Ukrainian President to publicly announce investigations:  I came to realize that I had firsthand knowledge regarding certain events on July 26 that had not otherwise been reported and that those events potentially bore on the question of whether the President did, in fact, have knowledge that those senior officials were using the levers of diplomatic power to influence the new Ukrainian President to announce the that point that I made the observation to Ambassador Taylor that the incident I had witnessed on July 26th had acquired greater significance, which is what he reported in his testimony last week and is what led to the subpoena for me to appear here today.716    Mr. Holmes testified that the touchstone piece of was going on with the 717  He elaborated:113  the President to have the meeting.  And use that repeatedly as a refrain.718114  6. The President Wanted Ukraine to Announce the Investigations Publicly   -picked representatives carried out his wishes to condition a coveted White House meeting for the Ukrainian President on the public announcement of investigations beneficial to President Trump.  Top U.S. officials, including the Secretary of State and Secretary of      Overview  In the weeks following the July 25 call, during which President Trump had pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , representatives worked to secure from the Ukrainian President a public announcement about the requested investigations as a condition for the White House meeting.    That meeting would have conferred vital support on a new president who relied on the United States to help defend his nation militarily, diplomatically, and politically against Russian aggression.  U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland provided testimony and including the Secretaries of State and Energy.  Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked closely with Mr. Giuliani, personal lawyer, to .  They sought to ensure that President Zelensky explicitly used a reference to allegations about former Vice President Biden and his son.  Ukrainian officials were with the provision of this statement, which they understood to be a requirement and a demanded by President Trump.  The Ukrainian President was elected on a platform of rooting out public corruption, and so he resisted issuing the statement.  Instead, request for legal assistance with investigations had been made through appropriate channels at the U.S. Department of Justice.  No such formal request was ever made.  Consequently, Ukrainian officials made clear to Ambassador Volker that they did not support issuing a public ss, U.S. efforts to secure a public statement continued.  Giuliani Met with Ukrainian Presidential Aide Andriy Yermak in Madrid and Discussed a White House Meeting   On July 26, the day after the call between President Trump and President Zelensky, Ambassador Volker wrote to Mr. Giuliani to confirm that he would soon be meeting with Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian presidential aide, 719    Ambassador Volker texted:  Yermak tomorrow morni720115  Mr. Giuliani replied that he would travel to Spain from August 1 to 5, and Ambassador Volker 721  Ambassador Volker kept himself apprised of plans, texting Mr. Yermak on August 1 to ensure Yermak planned to visit Washington.722    On August 2, Mr. Yermak and Mr. Giuliani met in Madrid.723  Ambassador Volker received a meeting summary from Mr. Yermak the same day:  Mr. Yermak added:  Sept.

Mr. Giuliani demanded that Ukraine make a public statement announcing investigations of the 2016 election/DNC server and Burisma.

Ukrainian Officials and Career State Department Became Increasingly Concerned  On August 13while Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Sondland, and Mr. Yermak were negotiating the draft statement about investigationsMr. Yermak asked Ambassador Volker 2016.  He appeared interested in knowing whether the U.S. Department of Justice had made an agency for legal assistance in such a matter.808  he stated 809   Ambassador Volker testified:  channels, Department of Justice to law enforcement in Ukraine, please investigate was there any effort to interfere in t810  Ambassador Volker explained:  He [Yermak] said, and I think quite appropriately, that if they [Ukraine] are responding to agree with that.811    official request made by the Department of Justice:  just 812    On September 25, July 25 call between President Trump and President Zelensky, a Justice Department spokesperson issued a statement, apparently confirming that no such formal request had been made:    The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son.

The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraineon this or any other subject.813    Ryaboshapka, who assumed his new position in late August 2019, told The Financial Times in late November 2019 that Attorney General Barr had made no formal request regarding a potential investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by former Vice President Biden.814  In an apparent demand that Ukraine interfere in U.S. elections, Mr. Ryaboshapka added:  est not to pull us into some conflicts between their ruling elites, but to continue to support so that we can cross the point of no return.815  Neither Ambassador Taylor in Ukraine nor Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent in Washington were aware of the efforts by Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, in coordination with Mr. Giuliani, to convince Ukrainian officials to issue a statement in real time.  Ambassador Taylor told the Committees that, on August 16, in a text message exchange with Ambassador Volker, h816  Ambassador Taylor noted t to the Ukrainians to 817    matter.818  egal aspects 819   On August 15, Ambassador Volker texted Ambassador Sondland that Mr. Yermak 820  Two days later, Ambassador Volker wrote:  calling a friend at  Volker testified that he was not able to connect with his contact at the Department of Justice.821    Mr. assistant, approached him to ask whether there was any precedent for the United States asking Ukraine to conduct investigations on its behalf.  Mr. Kent advised Ms. Croft:  or prosecute individuals for political reasons, the answer is, I ho-Soviet states for the last 28 years, which is the promotion of the rule of law.822  Mr. Kent testified that the day after his conversation with Ms. Croft, he spoke with o Mr. Kent in mid-August that Ukraine was124  being pressured to conduct politically-motivated investigations.  Mr. Kent told Ambassador 823   After speaking to Ms. Croft and Ambassador Taylor, Mr. Kent wrote a memo to file on prosecutions that were injurious to the rule of law, both in Ukraine and U.S.824  Mr. Kent testified:   At the time, I had no knowledge of the specifics of the [July 25] call record, but based on Yermak with Kurt Volker, at that point it was clear that the investigations that were being suggested were the ones that Rudy Giuliani had been tweeting about, meaning Biden, Burisma, and 2016.825  On August 17, Mr. Yermak reached out to both Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker.826  Ambassador Sondland texted Ambassador 827  Ambassador Volker responded that was contacting the Department of Justice to find out about requesting an investigation.828    Ambassador Sondland then asked:   [Zelensky] to give us an  message so far said that he would a Ambassador Volker replied that he had spoken to Mr. Yermak and suggested that he and Ambassador Sondland speak the following day, August 18, to discuss 829   Ambassador Volker claimed that Ukrainians around this time because of concerns raised by Mr. Yermak that Yuriy Lutsenko was still the Prosecutor General.  Mr. Lutsenko was likely to be replaced by President Zelensky, and because Mr. Lutsenko was alleging the same false claims that President Trump and Mr. Giuliani did not want to mention Burisma or 2016830  831    Mr. Yermak agreed and, according to Ambassador Volker, plans to put out a statement were 832  Ambassador Volker reasoned that the plan for a public statement did not anything, and, theref833  He added:   till you have your own prosecutor general in place.   substantive issues like this, security assistance and all.  834125   Ambassador Volker testified 835  Nevertheless, efforts to secure a presidential statement announcing the two investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 U.S. election interference continued well into September.      with Mr. Yermak:  that this was bigger than just a White House meeting and was about 836  Ambassador Volker told the Committees that he understood this referred to the level of trust that the President has with President Zelensky.  He has this general negative assumption about everything Ukraine, 837  That negative assumption would prove difficult to overcome as Ukrainian and U.S. officials sought to finally obtain a White House meeting and shake free from the White House hundreds of millions of dollars in Congressionally-approved security assistance for Ukraine.126  7. The President Conditioning of Military Assistance and a White House Meeting on Announcement of Investigations Raised Alarm   Following the public disclosure in late August 2019 of a hold on U.S. security assistance to an Oval Office meeting and the release of taxpayer-funded U.S. security assistancewas contingent on the Ukrainian president announcing investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  President Trump Bill Taylor warned that it    Overview  On August 28, 2019, Politico first reported that President Trump was withholding hundreds of millions of dollars of Congressionally-appropriated U.S. security assistance from Ukraine, a fact that had been previously suspected by Ukrainian officials in July.  Public revelations about the freeze raised questions about the U.S. commitment to Ukraine and harming efforts to deter Russian influence and aggression in Europe.    Around this time, American officials made clear to Ukrainians that a public announcement about investigations into Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden was a pre-conditionnot only to obtain a White House meeting for President Zelensky, but also to end the freeze on military and other security assistance for Ukraine.    to both U.S. and Ukrainian officials.  On September 1, he informed a senior Ukrainian official announce the investigations.  Later, on September 7, President Trump informed Ambassador Sondland that he wanted President Zelenskynot the Prosecutor Generalin demanded related to security assistance.  President Zelensky proceeded to schedule an interview on CNN in order to announce the investigations and satisfy President Trump.  political investigations troubled U.S. officials.  NSC Senior Director for Europe and Russia quid pro quo to National Security Advisor John Bolton, who advised him to Bill Taylor expressed his concerns to Ambassador Sondland, stating127  Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador Sondland Worked t  explanation to U.S. officials and contrary to the consensus recommendation of the national security team.  At the same time, President Trump refused to schedule a coveted White House visit for President Zelensky until he announced two investigations that could benefit American officials, including Ambassador Sondland and David Holmes, Counselor for Political Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, to conclude that the military assistance was conditioned on  public announcement of the investigations.838    On August 20, Ambassador Kurt Volker met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper.  Ms. Cooper and Ambassador Volker agreed that if the hold on security assistance 839  During this meeting, Ambassador Volker mentioned that he was talking to an advisor to U.S. elections and would commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election in840  Ambassador Volker indicated that if his efforts to get a statement were successful, the hold on security assistance might be lifted.841    Although he did not mention that conversation during his deposition, Ambassador Volker had a similar recollection, during his public testimony, of the meeting with Ms. Cooper.  Ambassador Volker recalled discussing with Ms. Cooper the draft statement that had been coordinated with Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yermakwhich included reference to the two investigations that President Trump demanded in the July 25 calland that such a statement  842    Around this time, Ambassador Sondland sought to assistance and the White House meeting by coordinating a meeting between the two Presidents through Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  On August 22, Ambassador Sondland emailed Secretary Pompeo, copying the s Executive Secretary, Lisa Kenna:   Should we block time in Warsaw for a short pull-aside for POTUS to meet Zelensky?  I folks are in place (mid-Sept) Ze should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus and to the US.  Hopefully, that will break the logjam.843  844   Potushe meant the investigation into the false allegations about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election and the investigation into the Bidens.845  He what was necessary to get the aid released, to break th846  Ambassador Sondland128  believed that President Trump would not release the aid until Ukraine announced the two investigations the President wanted.847   Ambassador Sondland testified:  to brief 848  He explained:   This was a proposed briefing that I was going to give President Zelensky, and I was going to call President Zelensky and ask him to say what is in this email.  And I was asking essentially  849  He then forwarded the email to Ms. Kenna-15 min on the -aside meeting.  The Ambassador stated that he was seeking confirmation in order to brief President Zelensky.  850    On August 24, Ukraine celebrated its Independence Day.

Ambassador Sondland sent Ambassador Bolton the information directly.853  Ambassador Sondland testified that he Ambassador Bolton requested the contact information.854    Ambassador Bolton Visited Kyiv  On August 27, Ambassador Bolton arrived in Kyiv for an official visit.

Almost immediately after the news became public, Ukrainian officials expressed alarm to their American counterparts.  Mr. Yermak sent Ambassador Volker a link to the Politico story and then texted:  861  Other Ukrainian officials also expressed concerns 862  On August 29, Mr. Yermak also contacted Ambassador Taylor to express that he was 863  Mr. Yermak and other Ukrainian to Washington to raise with U.S. officials the importance of the assistance.  Ambassador Taylor described confusion among Ukrainian officials over the hold on military aid:   figure out why this was They thought that there must be some rational reason for this how important this assistance was to their fight and to their armed forces.  And so maybe they could figureso they were just desperate.864    Without any official explanation for the hold, American officials could provide little reassurance to their Ukrainian counterparts. Ambassador Taylor continuedguidance that I could give them.865  -  The same day that Ambassador Taylor heard from Mr. Yermak about his concerns about the hold on military aid, Ambassador Taylor transmitted his classified, first-person cable to he sent such a cable to the Secretary of State.866  aid to Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level of American suppo867    Ambassador Taylor worried about the public message that such a hold on vital military  my deposition, would love to see the humiliation of President Zelensky at the hands of the 868  assistance to U.S. nation869  However, Mr. Holmes worried that the national security argument might not achieve its purpose given the reasons he130  assistance hold was likely intended by the President either as an expression of dissatisfaction with the Ukrainians, who had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigation, or as an effort 870  Mr. Holmes viewed t871  872    Ambassador Taylor never received a response to his cable, but was told that Secretary Pompeo carried it with him to a White House meeting about security assistance to Ukraine.873  Ambassador Sondland Told Senator Johnson  That Ukraine Aid Was Conditioned on Investigations  The next day, on August 30, Republican Senator Ron Johnson spoke with Ambassador Sondland to express his concern about President Trumpassistance to Ukraine.  According to Senator Johnson, Ambassador Sondland told him that if Ukraine would commit to if President Trump has 874  On August 31, Senator Johnson spoke by phone with President Trump regarding the decision to withhold aid to Ukraine.875  President Trump denied the quid pro quo that Senator Johnson had learned of from Ambassador Sondland.876  At the same time, however, President Trump refused to authorize Senator Johnson to tell Ukrainian officials that the aid would be forthcoming.877  The message that Ambassador Sondland communicated to Senator Johnson mirrored that used by President Trump during his July 25 call with President Zelensky, in which President  an investigation into the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to help Hillary Clinton.878  To the contrary, the U.S. Intelligence Community unanimously assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump, as did Special Counsel Robert Mueller.879   In a November 18 letter to House Republicans, Senator Johnson confirmed the accuracy of the account of his August 30 call with Ambassador Sondland.880    recollection of the August 30 call and testified that by late August 2019, he had concluded that t corruption, and specifically 881131  Ambassador Sondland Raised the Link Between Investigations and Security Assistance to Vice President Pence Before Meeting with President Zelensky  On September 1, President Trump was scheduled to meet President Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland during an event commemorating World War II.  Citing the approach of Hurricane Dorian towards American soil, the President canceled his trip just days beforehand.  Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Warsaw instead.882    Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia, learned leaving, [National Security Advisor to the Vice President] General Kellogg had asked, at the request of the Vice President, for an update on the status of the security assistance that was at  House officials expected that President Zelensky would seek further information on the status of the funds.883   The delegation arrived in Warsaw and gathered in a hotel room to brief the Vice President shortly before his engagement with President Zelensky.

The Washington Post later reported that one of ence:  897  lear means 898     Was Contingent on Ukraine Publicly Announcing the Investigations  After the bilateral meeting between Vice President Pence and President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland briefly spoke to Mr. Yermak.  Ambassador Sondland conveyed his belief that the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine took some kind of action on the public statement that we had been discussing for many 899  Immediately following the conversation, Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Morrison what had transpired during his aside with Mr. Yermak.

Informed by a review of contemporaneous notes that he took during his phone call, Ambassador Taylor testified:  During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.  Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian officials that only a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of the investigations.  In fact, Ambassador Sondland said,134  everything was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.  He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a public box, by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.912  President Trump 913  He ,referring to the investigations, ,referring to the security assistance.914  Ambassador Taylor also concurred with the statement quid pro quo.915    Ambassador Taylor testified that his contemporaneous notes of the phone call with announced publicly.916  Ambassador Sondland, who did not take contemporaneous notes of any of his conversations, did not dispute that he used those words.917  He also testified that, when he spoke to Mr. Yermak, he believed that it would be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of President Trump and Mr. Giuliani if the new Ukrainian prosecutor general issued a statement about investigations, but his understanding soon changed.918    President Trump Informed Ambassador Sondland that President Zelensky   On September 7, Ambassador Sondland called Mr. Morrison to report that he had just concluded a call with President Trump.  Mr. Morrison testified that Ambassador Sondland told him as no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must announce the opening of the 919  This led Mr. Morrison to believe that a public announcement of investigations by the Ukrainian presidentand not the prosecutor generalwas a prerequisite for the release of the security assistance.920  He reported the conversation to did.921    Later on September 7, Mr. Morrison relayed the substance conversation with President Trump to Ambassador Taylor.  Ambassador Taylor explained:   I had a conversation with Mr. Morrison in which he described a phone conversation earlier that day between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump.  Mr. Morrison said that he had a sinking feeling after learning about this conversation from Ambassador Sondland.  According to Mr. Morrison, President Trump told Ambassador Sondland he was not asking for a quid pro quo, but President Trump did insist that President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference and that President Zelensky should want to do this himself.  Mr. Morrison said that he told Ambassador Bolton and the NSC lawyers of this phone call between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland.922135  The following day, on September 8, Ambassador Sondland texted Ambassadors Volker and Taylor:  one minute later923  Zelensky himself had to clear things up and do it in public.  President Trump said it was not a quid pro quo924  Ambassador Sondland also shared that he told President Zelensky and Mr. quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up 925     Ambassador Taylor testified not receive the much-926  During his public testimony, Ambassador 927    Although Ambassador Sondland otherwise could not independently recall any details about his September 7 conversation with President Trump, he testified that he had no reason to dispute the testimony from Ambassador Taylor or Mr. Morrisonwhich was based on their contemporaneous notesregarding this conversation.928  Ambassador Sondland, however, did recall that President Zelensky agreed to make a public announcement about the investigations 929  According to Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Sondland explained that President Trump ow930  -funded U.S. security assistance.931  Ukrainians did not owe President Trump anything.  And holding up security assistance for 932  Ambassador Sondland did not recall this exchange specifically, 933    Ambassador Taylor Texted Ambassador Sondland that   Ambassador Taylor remained concerned was conditioned on President Zelensky publicly announcing the investigations.  He also worried that, even if the Ukrainian leader did as President Trump required, the President might continue to withhold the vital U.S. security assistance in any event.  Ambassador Taylor texted his concerns to Ambassadors Volker and Sondland stating:  934    Ambassador Taylor testified:   The nightmare is the scenario where President Zelensky goes out in public, makes an election, maybe among other things.  He might put that in some series of investigations.136  But ... the nightmare was he would mention those two, take all the heat from that, get himself in big trouble in this country and probably in his country as well, and the security assistance would not be released.  That was the nightmare.935  Early in the morning in Europe on September 9, Ambassador Taylor reiterated his concerns quid pro quoAmbassadors Volker and Sondland:  Taylor:   The message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key.  With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us.  Thus my nightmare scenario. Taylor:   Counting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon. Sondland:   have identified the best pathway forward.  Lets hope it works. Taylor:   help with a political campaign.936  effort.937  Ambassador Taylor testified:  The investigation of Burisma and the Bidens was clearly identified by Mr. Giuliani in public for months as a way to get 938    Ambassador Taylor framed the broader national security implications of President said:  [T]he United States was trying to support Ukraine as a frontline state against Russian attack.  And, again, the whole notion of a rules-based order was being threatened by the Russians in Ukraine.  So our security assistance was designed to support Ukraine.  And it was not just the United States; it was all of our allies.939    Ambassador Taylor explained:   [S]ecurity assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense.  It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do.  It was illogical.  It could not be explained.  It was crazy.940    Ambassador Sondland Repeated the Taylor, While He and President Trump Continued to Demand Public Investigations    withhold security denied that the President137  At approximately 5:17 a.m. Eastern Time, Ambassador Sondland responded to Ambassador Taylor:   Bill, I whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign.  I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.  If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S [Secretary Pompeo] a call to discuss them directly.  Thanks.941  Notably, Ambassador Sondland recalled that President Trump raised the possible existence of a quid pro quo entirely on his own, without any prompting.  Ambassador Sondland asked President Trump what he affirmatively wanted from Ukraine, yet President Trump reportedly responded by asserting what was not the case:   Q: the President directly if there was a quid pro quo, correct?   A: No.  As I testified, I asked the question open ended, what do you want from Ukraine? Q: Pre A:  That is correct.942    In contrast, Ambassador Sondland testified unequivocally there was a quid pro quo in connection to a telephone call between President Trump and President Zelensky, as well as a White House meeting for President Zelensky.943  He acknowledged that the reference to 944    Ambassador Sondland also testified that President Trump immediately followed his stated denial of a quid pro quo by demanding that President Zelensky still make a public announcement, while the military assistance remained on an unexplained hold.  Ambassador 945  Ambassador Sondland testified that nothing on his call with President Trump changed his understanding of a quid pro quo and, at ere conditioned on the public announcement of the investigations President Trump sought.946  After hearing from President Trump, Ambassador Sondland promptly told the Ukrainian leader and Mr. Yermak 947  President Zelensky responded to the demand relayed by Ambassador Sondland, by agreeing to make an announcement of investigations on CNN.948    Regardless of when the call between President Trump and Ambassador Sondland text message denying any quid pro quo occurred after the White House had been informed of the whistleblower complaint138  discussing the hold on security assistance.  The White House first received notice of the call with President Zelensky on August 26949  In addition, Ambassador Sondland wrote his text message on September 9, the same day that the ICcomplaint that was later revealed to be related to Ukraine.950  The Administration received prior 951    is the Only Evidence the Committees Received Indicating   Ambassador Sondland testified in his deposition that he sent a text message to Ambassador Taylor after speaking directly with President Trump on September 9.  However, testimony from other witnesses and documents available to the Committees do not confirm that Ambassador Sondland and President Trump spoke on that day.    the timing of the call.  At a public hearing on November 20, Ambassador Sondland testified that te Department and the 952  953 he acknowledged that he might have misremembered the date of the September 9 callon September 6thand that without his call records, he could not be certain about when he spoke to President Trump.954    After the deposition transcripts of Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison were made public, including their detailed accounts of the September 7 conversation that Ambassador Sondland had with President Trump, Ambassador Sondland submitted a written addendum to his 955  In that addendum, Ambassador Sondland with President Trump in the September 6-956    Furthermore, the conversation recalled by Ambassador Sondland as having taken place on September 9 is consistent with a conversation that Ambassador Sondland relayed to Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor during the previous two days.  Both Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor, after reviewing their contemporaneous written notes, provided detailed testimony example, Ambassador Sondland shared with Ambassador Taylor that even though President is no quid pro Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference.957  Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor both testified that this conversation occurred on September 7.958  Ambassador Sondland acknowledged that he had no basis to dispute the recollections of Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor.959  Ambassador Sondland,139  960  Text messages produced to the Committees also indicate that Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump prior to September 8.  On September 4, Ambassador Volker texted Mr. Yermak that Ambassador Sondland planned to speak to President Trump on September 6 or 7.  Ambassador Volker wrote:  trump on scheduling Ze visit.

If Ambassador Sondland spoke to President Trump after receiving Ambassador timing of the text messages would mean that President Trump took Ambassador Sondland call in the middle of the night in Washington, D.C.

On October 17, at a press briefing in the White House, Mr. Mulvaney confirmed that President Trump withheld the essential military aid for Ukraine as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, which was also promoted by Vladimir Putin.965  Mr. Mulvaney confirmed that President Trump ... 966  When the White House press corps attempted to clarify this acknowledgement of a quid pro quo policy. H967140  8.    President Trump lifted the hold on U.S. military assistance to Ukraine on September 11 after it became clear to the White House and President Trump that his scheme was exposed.      Overview   to Ukraine became public on his date, the White House had learned that the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), Michael Atkinson, had determined that a whistleblower complaint related to the same Ukraine  to the applicable statute, recommended to the Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Joseph Maguire, that the complaint should be transmitted to Congress.   In early September, bipartisan Members of both houses of Congresspublicly, and privatelyexpressed concerns to the White House about the hold on military assistance.  On September 9, after months of internal discussion due to growing concern about the activity of the Chairs of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform announced a joint investigation into efforts by President Trump and Mr. ent to assist the Congressionally-appropriated military assistance.    Later that same day, the ICIG notified Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes that, despite uniform past practice and a statucomplaints be provided to the intelligence committees, the Acting DNI was nevertheless withholding the whistleblower complaint from Congress.  The Acting DNI later testified that his office initially withheld the complaint on the advice of the White House, with guidance from the Department of Justice.     Two days later, on September 11, the President lifted the hold on the military assistance to Ukraine.  Numerous witnesses testified that they were never aware of any official reason for why the hold was either implemented or lifted.  Notwithstanding this ongoing inquiry, President Trump has continued to urge Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Biden.  For example, when asked by a Bidens in President Trump reiterated his affinity for the former Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Yuriy141    Public S  U.S. military assistance to Ukraine became public decision.968  On September 3, a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Rob Portman and Senator Ron Johnson, sent a letter to Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney g the Ukraine 969  970  On September 5, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent a letter to Mr. Mulvaney and Acting Director of the OMB funding for Ukraine.971  On September 5, the Washington Post editorial board reported concerns that President Trump was withholding military assistance for Ukraine and a White House meeting in order to force President Zelensky to announce investigations of Mr. Biden and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  The Post editorial board wrote:  sident has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.

But, as CNN reported, the Pentagon has already completed the study and recommended that the hold be lifted.  Yet Mr. Trump has not yet acted.  If his recalcitrance has a rationale, other than seeking to compel a foreign government to aid his reelection, the president has yet to reveal it.972  On the same day that the Washington Post published its editorial, Senators Christopher Murphy and Ron Johnson visited Kyiv, and met with President Zelensky.

NSC Senior Director for Russia and Europe Timothy Morrison recalled seeing a copy of the letter that was sent by the three Chairs to the White House.981  He also recalled that the three -level NSC staff soon after it was publicly announced.982  investigation to NSC staff members, although it is unclear exactly when.983  NSC Director for Ukraine Alexander Vindman recalled discussions among NSC staff members, including Mr. for the Administration  to the Congress.984143  Inspector General Notified Intelligence Committee that the Administration  Was Withholding Whistleblower Complaint   Later that same day, September 9, Inspector General Atkinson sent a letter to Chairman Adam Schiff and Ranking Member Devin Nunes notifying them that an Intelligence Community whistleblower had filed a complaint with the ICIG on August 12.985  Pursuant to a statute governing whistleblower disclosures, the Inspector Generalafter a condensed, preliminary review986  er 9 letter did not disclose the substance or topic of the whistleblower complaint.    Contrary to uniform past practice and the clear requirements of the whistleblower statute, Acting DNI Maguire withheld the whistleblower complaint based on advice from the White House.987  Acting DNI Maguire also relied upon an unprecedented intervention by the Department of Justice into Intelligence Cdetermination based on a preliminary investigation.988   The White House had been aware of the whistleblower complaint weeks prior to the  989  Acting DNI Maguire testified that, after receiving the whistleblower complaint from the Inspector General on August 26, his office contacted the White House 990    New York Times reported that in late August, Mr. Cipollone and National Security Council Legal Advisor John Eisenberg personally briefed President Trump about the complaand explained to the President that they believed the complaint could be withheld on executive privilege grounds.991  of Legal Counsel to determine whether they had to disclose the 992     On September 10, Chairman Schiff wrote to Acting DNI Maguire to express his concern ing the whistleblower complaint from the Congressional intelligence committees notwithstanding his 993  Chairman rgent and credible whistleblower complaint, as required by law, raises the prospect that an urgent matter of a 994     Also on September 10, Ambassador John Bolton resigned from his position as National departure related to the matters under investigation because neither he nor Dr. Kupperman agreed to appear for testimony as part of this inquiry.  On September 13, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) General144  ODNI could not transmit the complaint to the Committee at its discretion because it involved presumably presidential communications.995  In response, Chairman Schiff issued a subpoena to the Acting DNI on September 13 and announced to the public that ODNI was withholding a 996   Following intense pressure from the public and Congress, on September 25, the White House released the complaint to the intelligence committees and the July 25 call record to the public.997        President Trump Lifted the Hold on Military Assistance for Ukraine  On September 11two days after the three Committees launched their investigation into Maguire produce a copy of the whistleblower complaintPresident Trump lifted the hold on military assistance for Ukraine.    On the evening of September 11, prior to lifting the hold, President Trump met with Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Mulvaney, and Senator Portman to discuss the hold.998  Around 8:00  had been lifted.999    Just like there was no official explanation for why the hold on Ukraine security assistance was implemented, numerous witnesses testified that they were not provided with a reason for why the hold was lifted on September 11.1000  For example, Deputy Assistant Secretary of 1001  Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia, testified that from the time when she first learned about the hold on July 3 until it was lifted on September 11, she never came to understand why President Trump ordered the hold.1002      OMB Deputy Associate Director of National Security Programs Mark Sandy, who was the senior career official overseeing the administration of some of the Ukraine military assistance, only learned of a possible rationale for the hold in early Septemberafter the Acting DNI had informed the White House about the whistleblower complaint.1003  Mr. Sandy testified 1004  However, implemented the hold, and several weeks after the White House learned of the whistleblower complaint, Mr. Sandy received an email from OMB Associate Director of National Security Programs Michael Duffey.  For the first time, it 1005    Mr. Sandy testified that he was not aware of any other countries committing to provide more financial assistance to Ukraine prior to the lifting of the hold on September 11.1006  lifted the hold.1007145  After the Hold was Lifted, Congress was Forced to Pass a Law to Ensure All of the Military Aid Could Be Distributed to Ukraine  The lengthy delay created by the hold on Ukraine military assistance prevented the Department of Defense from spending all of the Congressionally-appropriated funds by the end of the fiscal year, which meant that the funds would expire on September 30 because unused funds do not roll over to the next fiscal year.1008  This confirmed the fears expressed by Ms. Cooper, Mr. Sandy, and others related to the illegal impoundment of Congressionally-mandated fundingconcerns that were discussed in some depth within the relevant agencies in late July and throughout August.1009    cerns that up to $100 million of military assistance could go unspent as a result of the hold imposed by the President.1010  Ultimately, approximately $35 million of Ukraine military assistance14% of the total fundsremained unspent by the end of fiscal year 2019.1011  Typically, DOD averages between 2 and 5 percent unspent funds for similar programs, substantially less than the 14 percent left unspent in this case.1012  In order to ensure that Ukraine did not permanently lose $35 million of the critical military assistance frozen by the White House,1013 Congress passed a provision on September 27three days before funds were set to expireto ensure that the remaining $35 million in 2019 military assistance to Ukraine could be spent.1014  Ms. Cooper testified that such an act of Congress was unusualindeed, she had never heard of funding being extended in this manner.1015  As of November 2019, Pentagon officials confirmed that the $35 million in security assistance originally held by the President and extended by Congress had still yet to be disbursed.  When asked for an explanation, the Pentagon only confirmed that the funds had not yet been spent but declined to say why.1016  Pressure to Announce Investigations Continued After the Hold was Lifted  Before President Trump lifted the hold on security assistance, Ukrainian officials had relented to the American pressure campaign to announce the investigations and had scheduled President Zelensky to appear on CNN.1017  Even after President Trump lifted the hold on September 11, President Zelensky did not immediately cancel his planned CNN interview.1018    On September 12, Ambassador Taylor personally informed President Zelensky and the 1019  might still be a plan for the CNN intewould announce the investigations that President Trump wanted Ukraine to pursue.1020  1021146  On September 13, a staff member at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv texted Mr. Holmes to 1022  The 1023    an presidential there were no plans for President Zelensky to announce the investigations during a CNN interview.1024  sor Oleksandr Danyliuk indicated that there were no plans for President Zelensky to do the CNN interview, Ambassador Taylor was still concerned after he and Mr. Holmes saw Mr. Yermak following the meeting.1025  dy language was such that it looked to me 1026  Mr. Holmes also recalled that when he and Ambassador Taylor ran into Mr. Yermak following the meeting, Ambassador e of staying out of U.S. politics and said he hoped no interview 1027  ed Zakaria, who was in Kyiv to moderate the Yalta European Strategy Conference.1028  During the meeting with Mr. Zakaria, President Zelensky did not cancel his planned CNN interview.1029  Conflicting advice prompted the Ukrainian foreign minister to observe in a meeting with Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Taylor, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, 1030  For example, at a September 14 meeting in Kyiv attended by Ambassador Volker, Mr. Yermak, and the Ukrainian foreign minister, Ambassador Volker stated that when the two willingness to open investigations in the two areas of interest to the President and that had been pushed previously by 1031  1032    On September 18 or 19, President Zelensky cancelled his scheduled interview with CNN.1033  Although President Zelensky did not publicly announce the investigations that President Trump wanted, he remains under pressure from President Trump, particularly because he requires diplomatic, financial, and military backing from the United States, the most powerful supporter of Ukraine.  That pressure continues to this day.  As Mr. Holmes testified:  [A]lthough the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted, there were still things they wanted that [the Ukrainians] wPresident in the Oval Office.  Whether the holdthe security assistance hold continued wanted important things from the President.147  us now going forward.  In fact, right now, President Zelensky is trying to arrange a summit meeting with President Putin in the coming weeks, his first face to face meeting with him to try to advance the peace process.  He needs our support.  He needs President end with the lifting of the security assistance hold.  Ukraine still needs us, and as I said, still fighting this war this very day.1034  Vice President Pence Spoke to President Zelensky  On September 18, approximately one week before President Trump was scheduled to meet with President Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Vice President Pence spoke with President Zelensky by telephone.1035  According to Ms. Williams, 1036    On November 26, Ms. Williams submitted a classified addendum to her hearing  that certain portions of the classified.  The Committee has requested that the Office of the Vice President conduct a declassification review so that the Committee may share this additional information regarding the substance of the September 18 call publicly.  On October 9, Vice President Pence told President Zelensky and sa1037  In a November 7 interview with Fox Business1038  President Trump and Rudy Giuliani, Undeterred, Continued to  Solicit Foreign Interference in Our Elections   On September 19, Rudy Giuliani was interviewed by Chris Cuomo on CNN.  During the interview, Mr. Giuliani confirmed that he had urged Ukraine to inthere was interference in the election of 2016, by the Ukrainians, for the benefit of Hillary Mr. Giuliani replied immediately,   Seconds later, Mr. Giuliani attempted to clarify his admission, insisting that he had not related to my client [President Trump], which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive country, invest1039148  President Trump also has continued to publicly urge President Zelensky to launch an investigation of Vice President Biden and alleged 2016 election interference by Ukraine.  On September 23, in a public press availability, President Trump stated:    I put no pressure on them whatsoever.  I could have.  I think it would probably, possibly, know why?  Because they want to do the right thing.1040  On September 24, in public remarks upon arriving at the opening session of the U.N. 1041    On September 25in a joint public press availability with President ZelenskyPresident I think, number oneon the basis of stopping corruption, which unfortunately has plagued Ukraine.  And if he could do that, d a big favor.  I know1042  On September 30, during his remarks at the swearing-in ceremony of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, President Trump stated:  Now, the new President of Ukraine ran on the basis of no corruptioelected.  And I believe that he really means it.  But there was a lot of corruption having to important that we do.1043  On October 2, in a public press availability, President Trump discussed the July 25 call with President Zelensky   The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the in, I believe, 1999, there was a corruption act or a corruption bill passed between bothand signedbetween both countries, where I have a duty to report corruption.  And let 1044    On October 3, in remarks before he departed on Marine One, President Trump expressed stated that he had hopedafter his July 25 conversationshould start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with149  Lutsenko, who had recently bway.1045  The next day, on October 4, in remarks before he departed on Marine One, the President again said:    When you look at what Biden and his son did, and when you look at other people  think there was beyondI mean, beyond corruptionhaving to do with the 2016 campaign, and what these lowlifes did to so many people, to hurt so many people in the Trump campaignwhich was successful, despite all of the fighting us.  I mean, despite all of the unfairness.1046    President Trump reiterated his willingness to solicit foreign assistance related to his 2016 campaignthere was tremendous corruption against mehave a right to go to a foreign c1047  President Trump added that asking President Xi of 1048  understood that referenand former Vice President Bidenand the 2016 election interference that President Trump sought to benefit his reelection efforts.1049  -Corruption Efforts in Ukraine   Rather than combatting ongoing efforts to urge Ukraine to pursue an investigation into former Vice President Biden undermine longstanding U.S. anti-corruption policy, which encourages countries to refrain from using the criminal justice system to investigate political opponents.  When it became clear that President Trump was pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, career public servants charged with implementing U.S. foreign policy in a non-partisan manner, such as Lt. Col. Vindman and Ambassador Taylor, communicated to President Zelensky and his advisors that Ukraine should avoid getting embroiled in U.S. domestic politics.1050  Mr. Kent, an anti-corruption and rule of law expert, explained that U.S. anti-corruption efforts prioritize building institutional capacity so that the Ukrainian Government has the ability to go after corruption and effectively investigate, prosecute, and judge alleged criminal activities using appropriate institutional mechanisms, that is, to create and follow the rule of law. 1051   Mr. Holmes concurred:   [O]ur longstanding policy is to encourage them [Ukraine] to establish and build rule of law institutions, that are capable and that are independent and that can actually pursue150  some success.  So focusing on [particular] cases, including [] cases where there is an we would do that.1052    Mr. Kent emphasized concerns about the -corruption efforts.1053  Ambassador Taylor damage that respect, then it hurts our credibility and makes it more difficult for us to do our 1054  Mr. Kent, like many other witnesses, explained that urging Ukraine to engage in generally:   As a general principle, I do not believe the United States should ask other countries to engage in selective politically associated investigations or prosecutions against opponents of those in power because such selective actions undermine the rule of law, regardless of the country.1055    Mr. Kent agreed that pressuring Ukraine to conduct political investigations is not a part of U.S. foreign policy to promote the rule of law in Ukraine and around the world.1056  Mr. Kent  and countries, in the post-1057     These conflicting messages came to a head at a September 14 meeting between American and Ukrainian officials in Kyiv.  During that meeting, Ambassador Volker advised Mr. Yermak contemplating into former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.1058  Mr. Yermak retorted, 1059  Ambassador Volker did not respond.1060151  SECTION I ENDNOTES 1 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 16-17. 2 Kateryna Handziuk, Ukrainian Activist, Dies From Acid Attack, New York Times (Nov. 5, 2018) (online at www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/world/europe/kateryna-handziuk-dies-ukraine.html). 3 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 30-31. 4 U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, Department of State, Courage Reception in Honor of Kateryna Handziuk (Apr. 24, 2019) (online at https://ua.usembassy.gov/ambassador-yovanovitchs-remarks-at-a-women-of-courage-reception-in-honor-of-kateryna-handziuk/). 5 U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, Department of State, Courage Reception in Honor of Kateryna Handziuk (Apr. 24, 2019) (online at https://ua.usembassy.gov/ambassador-yovanovitchs-remarks-at-a-women-of-courage-reception-in-honor-of-kateryna-handziuk/). 6 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 31. 7 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 31-32. 8 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 32. 9 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 31. 10 Yovanovitch Hearing Tr. at 31-32. 11 Giuliani to J, New York Times (April 19, 2018) (online at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/giuliani-trump.html).  12 Letter from John M.

The Ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen.  During a conference call with Ambassador Volker, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Phil Reeker, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Sondland, and Counsel of the U.S. Department of State Ulrich Brechbuhl on June 18, it was clear that a meeting between the two presidents was an agreed- 463  464 Taylor Dep.

Q: But Ambassador Sondland made it clear not only that he didn't wish to include most of the regular interagency participants but also that no one was transcribing or monitoring the call as they added President Zelensky. What struck you as odd about that? A: Same concern. That is, in the normal, regular channel, the State Department operations center that was putting the call together would stay on the line, in particular when you were having a conversation with the head of state, they would stay on the line, transcribe, take notes so that there could be a record of the discussion with this head of state. It is an official discussion. When he wanted to be sure that there was not, the State Department operations center agreed. 468 Taylor Dep. Tr. at 26. 469 Taylor Dep.

But he did tell me that he planned to start reaching out to former Mayor of New York, Rudy Giuliani.  And when I asked him why, he said that it was clear that the former mayor had influence on the President in terms of the way the President though of Ukraine.  And I think by that moment in time, that was self-evidence to anyone who was working on the issues, and therefore, it made sense to try to engage the mayor.  When I raised with Kurt, I said, about what?  Because former Mayor Giuliani has a track record of, you know, asking for a visa for a corrupt former prosecutor.  He attacked Masha, and t should be investigated.  My response to him was asking another country to investigate a prosecution for political  485 Kurt Volker Document Production, Bates KV00000036 (Oct. 2, 2019). 486 Kurt Volker Document Production, Bates KV00000036 (Oct. 2, 2019). 487 Kurt Volker Document Production, Bates KV00000006 (Oct. 2, 2019). 488 Volker Transcribed Interview Tr. at 308; Kurt Volker Document Production, Bates KV00000018 (Oct. 2, 2019). 489 Volker Transcribed Interview Tr. at 138.  490 Sondland Hearing Tr. at 23. 491 Hill Dep.

And Ambassador Bolton immediately stiffened.  He said words to the effectbehind them sitting on the sofa with our Senior Director of Energy, and we all kind of looked up and thought that was somewhat odd. And Ambassador Bolton immediately stiffened and ended the meeting.  Q:  Right then, he just ended the meeting?  A:  was very abrupt. I mean, he looked at the clock as if he had, you know, suddenly another meeting and his time was up, but it was obvious he ended the meeting. 494  of a meeting between the two Presidents.

Q: And what do you recall specifically of what Sondland said to the Ukrainians  A:  Right.  Q:  in the Ward Room?  A:  So that is right, the conversation unfolded with Sondland proceeding to kind of, you know, review what the deliverable would be in order to get the meeting, and he talked about the investigation Burisma, that it seemedI mean, there was no ambiguity, I guess, in my mind.  He was calling for  Q:  Okay. Ambiguity in your mind is different from what you  A:  Sure.  Q:  actually heard?  A:  Right. Correct.  Q:  What did you hear Sondland say?  A:  That the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens.  Q:   A:  To the best of my recollection, yes.  Q:  Okay. Did he mention 2016?

A:  My visceral reaction to what was being called for suggested that it was explicit. There was no ambiguity.  A: Again, based on my visceral reaction, it was explicit what he was calling for.  And to the best of   A So the meeting that occurred in the Ward Room referenced investigations into the Bidens, to the best of my recollection, Burisma and 2016 500 Hill Dep.

Q: Did Ambassador Sondlandwere the Ukrainian officials in the room when he was describing the need for these investigations in order to get the White House meeting? A: So they were in the room initially.  I think, once it became clear that there was some sort of discord amongst the government officials in the room, Ambassador Sondland asked them to step out of the room. Q: What was the discord? A: The fact that it was clear that I, as the representativeI, as the representative of the NSC, thought it was inappropriate and that we were not going to get involved in investigations. Q: Did you say that to Ambassador Sondland? A: Yes, I did. 504 Vindman Dep. Tr. at 18.   While not specifically disagreeing with any of the content of the discussion in the Ward Room, Vindman described yelling or screaming in the meetings.    th the documentary example, Sondland provided text from a July 13 email that he sentnot to Dr. Hill, but to her successor Tim Morrisonwhich  to Mr. Morrison, not Dr. Hill.  Mr. Morrison had not yet started working as NSC Senior Director for Europe and was not at the July 10 meeting. 505 Vindman Dep. Tr. at 29.  A: So I heard him say that this had been coordinated with White House Chief of Staff Mr. Mick Mulvaney.  Q: What did he say about that?

RUCTION OF THE HOUSE  IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY203  1. Constitutional Authority for Congressional Oversight and Impeachment   of its Article I powers.  The Supreme Courtand previous Presidentshave acknowledged these authorities.   Overview  clear, as is the duty of the President to cooperate with the robust oversight powers.  As the Founders intended, the courts have agreed, and prior Presidents have acknowledged, the Himpeachment inquiry of a President.  Congress has also enacted statutes to support its power to investigate and oversee the Executive Branch.  Unlike President Donald J. Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment to varying degreescomplied with information requests and subpoenas.  Even so, the House has previously determined that partial noncooperation can serve as a ground for an article of impeachment against a President as it would upend the separation of powers to allow the President to dictate the scope of an impeachment inquiry.  When President Richard Nixon withheld tape recordings and produced heavily edited and inaccurate records, the House Judiciary Committee approved an article of impeachment for obstruction.   Constitutional Power of Congress to Investigateand to Impeach  er of 1  The Framers intended the impeachment power to be an essential check on a President who might engage in corruption or abuse power.  For example, during the Constitutional Convention, George Mason stated:  No point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued. Shall any man be above Justice?  Above all shall that man be above it, who can commit means procured his appointment in the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment, by repeating his guilt?2    Congress is empowered to conduct oversight and investigations to carry out its authorities under Article I.3  In light of the core nature of the impeachment power to thduring an impeachment inquiry.4204  As the House Judiciary Committee explained during the impeachment of President Nixon:  Whatever the limits of legislative power in other contextsand whatever need may otherwise exist for preserving the confidentiality of Presidential conversationsin the context of an impeachment proceeding the balance was struck in favor of the power of inquiry when the impeachment provision was written into the Constitution.5  This conclusion echoed an early observation on the floor of the House of Representatives implied the right to inspect every paper and transaction in any department, otherwise the power 6   Constitution to hold sitting Presidents accountable for serious misconduct.  The Department of view that a sitting President cannot be indicted or face criminal prosecution while in office.7  The osition that the President is immune from prosecution has not been endorsed by Congress or the courts, but as long as the Department continues to refuse to prosecute a sitting President, Congress has a heightened responsibility to exercise its impeachment power, if 8    The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has broad oversight authority under the Constitution to inquire about a wide array of topics, even outside the context of impeachment:  The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate.  The scope of the power of inquiry, in short, is as penetrating and farreaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.9      The Supauthority to compel the production of information by issuing subpoenas,10 a power the House has  the Rules of its 11    The Supreme Court has affirmed that compliance with Congressional subpoenas is mandatory:  It is unquestionably the duty of all citizens to cooperate with the Congress in its efforts to obtain the facts needed for intelligent legislative action.  It is their unremitting obligation to respond to subpoenas, to respect the dignity of the Congress and its committees and to testify fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation.12205  Federal courts havCongressional subpoenas -separation of powers principles in the Constitution.13  As one court recently explained:  [W]hen a committee of Congress seeks testimony and records by issuing a valid blessing, and ultimately, it is acting not in its own interest, but for the benefit of the People of the United States.  If there is fraud or abuse or waste or corruption in the federal government, it is the constitutional duty of Congress to find the facts and, as necessary, take corrective action.  Conducting investigations is the means that Congress ucenturies-old power to compel the performance of witnesses is not an abstract injury, nor is it a mere banal insult to our democracy.  It is an affront to the mechanism for curbing abuses of power that the Framers carefully crafted for our protection, and, thereby, recalcitrant witnesses actually undermine the broader interests of the People of the United States.14  Laws Passed by Congress  Congress has enacted statutes to support its power to investigate and oversee the Executive Branch.  These laws impose criminal and other penalties on those who fail to comply with inquiries from Congress or block others from doing so, and they reflect the broader Constitutional requirement to cooperate with Congressional investigations.  For example:   Obstructing Congress:  Obstructing a Congressional investigation is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.  An individual is guilty of obstruction if he or she influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to infand proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is 15   Concealing Material Facts:  Concealing information from Congress is also punishable conducted pursuant to the authority of any committee, subcommittee, commission or 16   Intimidating and Harassing Witnesses:  Intimidating witnesses in a Congressional investigation is a crime punishable by up to twenty years in prison.  This statute applies  any person in an official 17  y fines and up to three years in prison.18206   Retaliating Against Employees Who Provide Information to Congress:  Employees who speak to Congress have the right not to have adverse personnel actions taken against them.  Retaliatory actions taken against Executive Branch employees who cooperate with Congress may constitute violations of this law.19  Any Executive Branch official who employee of the federal government from speaking with Congress could have his or her salary withheld.20   Precedent of Previous Impeachments and Other Investigations  Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiriesincluding Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clintongrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas.    evidence that Johnson ever asserted any privilege to prevent disclosure of presidential 21    Similarly, President Clinton provided written responses to 81 interrogatories from the House Ju22    Even President Nixon agreed to let his staff testify voluntarily in the Senate Watergate requested by the committee.  They will testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper 23  As a result, numerous senior White House officials testified, including White House Counsel John Dean III, White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman, Deputy Assistant to the President Alexander Butterfield, and Chief Advisor to the President for Domestic Affairs John D. Ehrlichman.24  President Nixon also produced numerous documents and records in ry, including more than 30 transcripts of White House recordings and notes from meetings with the President.25    did not produce tape recordings, and transcripts he produced were heavily edited or inaccurate.  President Nixon claimed that his noncompliance with House subpoenas was necessary to protect the confidentiality of Presidential conversations, but the House Judiciary Committee rejected these arguments and approved an impeachment inquiry.26    In a letter to President Nixon, Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter Rodino explained that it would upend the separation of powers to allow the President to dictate the scope of an impeachment inquiry:207  Under the Constitution it is not within the power of the President to conduct an inquiry into his own impeachment, to determine which evidence, and what version or portion of that evidence, is relevant and necessary to such an inquiry.  These are matters which, under the Constitution, the House has the sole power to determine.27     Consistent with that long-settled understanding, other Presidents have recognized that they must comply with information requests issued in a House impeachment inquiry.  In 1846, for example, President James Polk stated in a message to the House:  It may be alleged that the power of impeachment belongs to the House of Representatives, and that with a view to the exercise of this power, that House has the right to investigate the conduct of all public officers under the government.  This is cheerfully admitted.  In such a case, the safety of the Republic would be the supreme law; and the power of the House in the pursuit of this object would penetrate into the most secret recesses of the executive departments.  It could command the attendance of any and every agent of the government, and compel them to produce all papers, public or private, official or unofficial, and to testify on oath to all facts within their knowledge.28  Past Presidents have also produced documents and permitted senior officials to testify in connection with other Congressional investigations, including inquiries into Presidential actions.  For example, in the Iran-Contra inquiry, President Ronald Security Advisor, Oliver North, and the former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, John Poindexter, testified before Congress.29  excerpts of his personal d30  During the Clinton Administration, Congress obtained testimony from top advisors to President Bill Clinton, including Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum, and White House Counsel Jack Quinn.31  Similarly, in the Benghazi investigation, led by Chairman Trey Gowdy, President Barack Obama made many of his top aides available for transcribed interviews, including National Security Advisor Susan Rice and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Benjamin Rhodes.32  The Obama Administration also produced more than 75,000 pages of documents in that investigation, including 1,450 pages of White House emails containing communications of senior officials on the National Security Council.33208  2.    President Trump categorically directed the White House, federal departments and agencies, comply with duly authorized subpoenas for documents or testimony.   Overview  Donald Trump is the first and only President in American history to openly and indiscriminately defy all aspects of the Constitutional impeachment process, ordering all federal agencies and officials categorically not to comply with voluntary requests or compulsory demands for documents or testimony.    impeach him under the Constitution and that themaybe is acting in an unprecedented way and using unprecedented rules.  However, the House has been following the same investigative rules that Republicans championed when they were in control.  On October 8, White House Counsel Pat Cipolloneacting on behalf of President Trumpsent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the three investigating Committees confirming that President Trump directed his entire Administration not to cooperate with the   Mr. Cipolspectrum.  He advanced remarkably politicized arguments and legal theories unsupported by the Constitution, judicial precedent, and more than 200 years of history.  If allowed to stand, the   rump  In January, the House of Representatives voted to adopt its rules for the 116th Congress.  These rules authorized House committees to conduct investigations, hold hearings, issue subpoenas for documents and testimony, and depose witnesses.34  Significantly, these authorities are similar to those adopted when Republicans controlled the House during previous Congresses.35  In April, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who was appointed by then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and potential obstruction of justice by President Trump, issued a two-volume report.36  In connection with that report, the Committee on the Judiciary began an inquiry int37  The Judiciary209  Committee detailed its authority and intent to conduct this investigation in a series of reports, memoranda, and legal filings.38    On August 22, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter requesting that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Oversight and Reform, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Financial n, including documents and testimony, depositions, and/or interview 39    In September, the Intelligence Committee, the Oversight Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee sent letters requesting documents and interviews from the White House and Rudy Giuliani, and others to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy theory alleging Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.40   On September 22, President Trump admitted to discussing former Vice President Biden and his son with the President of Ukraine during a telephone call on July 25.41  On September 24, Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated publicly that the House Committees were   She explained that, for the past seveconsider whether to exercise its full Article I powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity42  On September 25, the White House made public a Memorandum of Telephone detail in Section I, this call record documented how President Trump directly and explicitly asked President Zelensky to launch investigations of former Vice President Biden and the 2016 election.43   Committee, the Oversight Committee, and the Foreign Affairs Committee continued their investigation, requesting documents and information, issuing subpoenas, and conducting interviews and depositions.  The Committees made clear that this information would be 44   On October 31, the House voted to approve House Resolution 660, directing the investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States he resolution set forth the process for holding public hearings, releasing deposition transcripts, presenting a report to the Judiciary Committee, holding proceedings210  reso45     testimony and conceal documentary evidence from the Committees investigating his conduct as basic tenets of the Constitutional system of checks and balances.  Even before the House of Representatives launched its investigation regarding Ukraine, President Trump made numerous statements rejecting the fundamental authority of Congress to investigate his actions as well as those of his Administration.  For example, on April 24, he stated, in response to Congressional 46  47  When the three investigating Committees began dispute public reports of his misconduct, but to persuade the public that the House lacks authority to investigate the President and the inquiry is therefore invalid and fraudulent.  For example, the President described the impeachment inquiry as:   48  illegal, 49   50   51   52  53  54  55   56  57   58  59   60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67211   to Democratsare doing to 68    A common theme of acting in an unprecedented way and using unprecedented rules.  However, the House has been following the same investigative rules that Republicans championed when they were in control and conducted aggressive oversight of previous Administrations.69    On October 8, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and the three Committees explaining that President Trump had directed his entire Administration not to   Consistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances.70  On October 10, President Trump confirmed that Mr. Cipollone was indeed conveying his orders, stating:  As our brilliant White House Counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people.  will defeat them.71  ss the political spectrum.72    Mr. Cipollone wrote a second letter to the Committees on October 18, declaring that the White House would refuse to comply with the subpoena issued to it for documents.73  On November 1after the House had already issued several subpoenas to White House and other Executive Branch officials for testimonythe Trump Administration issued a new of Legal Counsel opinion sought to extend thCongressional subpoenas and to justify noncompliance by officials who could not plausibly be212   long-standing deposition rules do not allow the participation of attorneys from the White House or other government agencies.74  These claims are without basis and unsupported by precedent.    The Letter Opinion cited statements from previous Presidents and Attorneys General that   For example, President James K. Polk, stated the most secret recesses 75  In addition, Attorney General Robert H. Jackson, who later rmation would be supplied in impeachment proceedings, usually instituted at the suggestion of the Department and for the 76   politicized arguments and legal theories unsupported by the Constitution, judicial precedent, and chment under the Constitution.  They are rebutted as follows:   The Impeachment Inquiry is Constitutional:  77  78  Speaking for President Trump, Mr. Cipollone also asserted that the impeachment inquiry  e day he was 79  However, as this report details in Section I, Congress found abundant evidence of a scheme directed by the President to solicit foreign election interference by pressing the newly-elected President of Ukraine to announce publicly politically-motivated the Constitutional valview that he did nothing wrong or on the political composition of the House.  Such an extreme reimagining of the Constitution would render the Article I impeachment power meaningless and provide the President with power the Constitution does not grant him to thwart, manipulate, and stonewall an impeachment inquiry conducted by the House, including by concealing information of his own misconduct.80  Taken to its logical  position would eliminate the impeachment power in every approach, the impeachments of President Clinton, President Nixon, and President Andrew Johnson would not have been permitted.81  The purpose of an impeachment inquiry is for the House to collect evidence to determine for itself whether the President may have committed an impeachable offense warranting articles of impeachment.  Because the Constitution vests the Housexercising that power properly or prudently.  The President is not free to arrogate the213  or to order across-the-board defiance of House subpoenasbased solely on his unilateral characterization of legislative motives or because he    The Impeachment Inquiry is Properly Authorized:  According to Mr. Cipollone, the ot expressly adopted any resolution authorizing an impeachment 82  However, nothing in either the Constitution or the House Rules requires the full House to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry.83  The impeachment inquiries into Presidents approval of a resolution authorizing the investigations.84  The same is true of many judicial impeachments;85 indeed, numerous judges have been impeached without any prior vote of the full House authorizing a formal inquiry.86  argument is inherently invalid, the House has taken two floor votes that render it obsoletethe first on January 9 to adopt rules authorizing committees to conduct investigations, and the second on October 31 to set forth procedures for open hearings in the Intelligence Committee and for additional proceedings in the Judiciary Committee.87  Even following passage of House Resolution 660, whereby the House confirmed the preexisting and ongoing impeachment inquiry, the President and the White House     President Has No Valid Due Process Claims:  Committees have not established any procedures affording the President even the most basic protections demanded by due process under the Constitution and by fundamental ve denied the President the right to cross-examine witnesses, to call witnesses, to receive transcripts of testimony, to have access to 88  Yet, there is no requirement that the House provide these procedures during an impeachment inquiry.  The Constitution vests the House chooses to conduct its impeachment process.89  complaints are unfounded as the House has implemented procedural protections for the President in its exercise of its Constitutional power.  House Resolution 660 authorizes 90  The Committee Report accompanying House Resolution 660 explains that these protections those provided during the Nixon and Clinton ithe president and his counsel are invited to attend all hearings; the ability for the -examine witnesses and object to the admissibility of  counsel to make presentations of evidence 91     Fact-Finding Was Appropriately Transparent:  According to Mr. Cipollone, the 92   This argument fundamentally misconstrues and misapprehends the fact-gathering process required at this initial stage of the House conducted a significant portion of the factual investigation itself because no214  regarding Ukraine.  Attorney General William P. Barr refused to authorize a criminal investigation into the serious allegations of misconduct, and even this decision was limited to possible violations of federal campaign finance laws.93  The investigative with investigative best practices, including the need to reduce the risk that witnesses may try to coordinate or align testimony.  As the House explained in its report accompanying House Resolution 660:    The initial stages of an impeachment inquiry in the House are akin to those preceding a prosecutorial charging decision.  Under this process, the House is responsible for collecting the evidence and, rather than weighing the question of returning an indictment, the Members of the House have the obligation to decide whether to approve articles of impeachment.94    The Committees have released transcripts of all interviews and depositions conducted during the investigation.  As these transcripts make clear, all Members of all three Committeesincluding 47 Republican Members of Congresshad the opportunity to ask questions, and these transcripts are now available to the President and his counsel.  These same procedures were supported by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when he served as a Member of the Oversight Committee and by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he served as a Member of the Benghazi Select Committee.  In fact, some of the same Members and staff currently conducting depositions as part of the present impeachment inquiry participated directly in depositions during the Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations.95  The Intelligence Committee also held public hearings with 12 of these witnesses.   Agency Attorneys Can Be (And Should Be) Excluded from Depositions:  According to Mr. Cipollone,  participating in congressional 96  Mr. Cipollone cites no case law to support his positionbecause there is none.  Instead, he relies on a single opinion from the Trump rity and 97 which includes the power to determine the procedures used for gathering information from witnesses whether via interview, staff deposition, or in a public hearing.98  The basis for the rule excluding agency counsel is straightforward:  it prevents agency officials who are directly implicated in the abuses Congress is investigating from trying to prevent their own employees from coming forward to tell the truth to Congress.  The rule protects the rights of witnesses by allowing them to be accompanied in depositions by personal counsel.  Agency attorneys have been excluded from Congressional depositions of Executive Branch officials for decades, under both Republicans and Democrats, including Chairmen Dan Burton, Henry Waxman, Darrell Issa, Jason Chaffetz, Trey Gowdy, Kevin Brady, and Jeb Hensarling, among others.99215   Congress Can Exercise Its Broad Oversight Authority:  According to Mr. Cipollone, unauthorized impeachment inquiry that conflicts with all historical precedent and rides 100  But, of course, the present impeachment inquiry does neither.  Moreover, the Supreme Court has made clear that wer to 101  The subject matter of the impeachment -specific as well as legislative and oversight authorities and interests.  The activity under investigation, for instance, relates to a broad array of issues in which Congress has legislated and may legislate in the future, including government ethics and transparency, election integrity, appropriations, foreign affairs, abuse of power, bribery, extortion, and obstruction of justice.  In fact, Members of Congress have already introduced legislation on issues related to the impeachment inquiry.102  The House does not forfeit its Constitutional authority to investigate and legislate when it initiates an impeachment inquiry.103  Congress passed sweeping legislative reforms following the scandal over the Watergate break-in and President 104   According to Mr. Cipollone, the 105  There is no basis in the law of executive privilege for declaring a categorical refusal to respond to any House subpoena.  In an impeachment inquiry, the the   Only the President can assert executive executive privilege, the Executive Branch is obligated to seek to accommodate the legitimate informational needs of Congress, which, as discussed below, it has not done.106  In any event, much of the information sought by the Committees would not be covered by executive privilege under any theory,107 and the privilegewhere validly asserted on a particularized basis and not outweighed by the legitimate needs of the impeachment inquirywould protect any legitimate Executive Branch interest in confidentiality.108    According to Mr. Cipollone, the Congress.109  This extreme position has been explicitly and repeatedly rejected by Congresswhich has received testimony from senior aides to many previous Presidentsand by federal courts.  In 2008, a federal court rejected an assertion by President George W. Bush that White House Counsel Harriet Miers was immune from being compelled to testify, noting that the President had failed to identify even a single judicial opinion to justify his claim.110  On November 25, 2019, another federal judge of recorded American history is that Presidents are not branch officials are not absolutely immune from compulsory congressional processno matter how many times the Executive branch has asserted as much over the yearseven216  -compl111  position, adopted by President Trump, has thus been repudiated by Congress and the courts, and is not salvaged by Executive Branch legal opinions insisting upon a wholly fictional ground for non-compliance.  In ordering categorical defiance of House subpoenas, President Trump has confirmed the unlimited breadth of his position and his unprecedented view that no branch of governmenteven the Houseis empowered to investigate whether he may have committed constitutional offenses.   In addition to advancing specious legal arguments, President Trump has made no effort to   For example, the Committees first requested documents from the White House on September 9, but the White House disregarded the request.112  The Committees made a second request on September 24, but the White House again ignored the request.113  Finally, on October 4, the Committees transmitted a subpoena for the documents.114  However, on October 18, the White House Counsel sent a 115  Since then, there has been no evidence of a willingness by the President to produce any of the documents covered by the subpoena to the White House.  The State Department made September 27 subpoena.116  However, there has been no effort to do so, and departments and agencies have not produced any documents in response to subpoenas issued as part of the House need for witness testimony and instead continued to flatly refuse to allow Executive Branch officials to testify.217  3.    key witnesses refused to produce any documents in response to duly authorized subpoenas i   Overview   by the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy in response to 71 specific, individualized requests or demands for records in their possession, custody, or control.

The White House  On September 9, the Committees sent a letter to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone the President and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, appear to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels to coerce the Ukrainian government into pursuing two politically-motivated investigations under the guise of anti-117  The Committees asked the White House to voluntarily produce responsive documents by September 16.118  The White House did not provide any response by that date.  On September 24, the Committees sent a follow-up letter requesting that the White House produce the documents by September 26.119  Again, the White House did not provide any documents or respond by that date.   Having received no response from the White House, then-Chairman Elijah E. Cummings sent a memorandum to Members of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, which has jurisdiction over the Executive Office of the President, explaining that he was preparing to issue -compliance and non-responsiveness.  He wrote:218  Over the past several weeks, the Committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage withor even respond tothe Committees.120  On October 4, the Committees sent a letter to Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney transmitting a subpoena issued by Chairman Cummings compelling the White House to produce documents by October 18.121  As discussed above, on October 8, the White House Counsel sent a letter to Speaker participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances122  The White House Counsel also 123  To date, the White House has not produced a single document in response to the subpoena.124  Instead, the White House has released to the public only two documentscall 125    Witnesses who testified before the Committees have identified multiple additional documents that the President is withholding that are directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry, including but not limited to:   by Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, Director for Ukraine at the National Security Council;126    notes relating to the July 25 call taken by Lt. Col. Vindman and Tim Morrison, the former Senior Director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council;127    128    National Security Council staff summaries of conclusions from meetings at the principal, deputy, or sub-deputy level relating to Ukraine, including military assistance;129    call records between President Trump and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, United States Ambassador to the European Union;130    National Security Council Legal Advisor relating to discussions with Lt. Col. Vindman regarding the July 10 meetings in which Ambassador Sondland requested investigations in exchange for a White House meeting;131     the memorandum of conversation fPresident Zelensky on September 25;132 and219   as explained below, emails and other messages between Ambassador Sondland and senior White House officials, including Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff Rob Blair, and then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, among other high-level Trump Administration officials.133   The Committees also have good-faith reason to believe that the White House is in possession of and continues to withhold significantly more documents and records responsive to the subpoena and of direct relevance to the impeachment inquiry.   The Committees have closely tracked public reports that the White House is in possession of other correspondence and records of direct relevance to the impeachment inquiry.  On November 24, for instance, a news report revealed that the White House had conducted a confidential, internal records review of the hold on military assistance in response to the extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over 134   Office of the Vice President  On October 4, the Committees sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence seeking 13 categories of documents in response to reports that he and his staff were directly involved in the matters under investigation.  The Committees wrote:  Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in reports include specific references to a member of your staff who may have participated directly in the July 25, 2019, call, documents you may have obtained or reviewed, including the record of the call, and your September 1, 2019, meeting with the Ukrainian President in Warsaw, on U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.135   The Committees asked the Vice President to produce responsive documents by October 15.136  On that date, Matthew E. Morgan, Counsel to the Vice President, responded to the Committees by refusing to cooperate and reciting many of the same baseless arguments as the White House Counsel.  He wrote:  that calls into question your commitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights. Representatives voting to authorize a constitutionally acceptable process.137   To date, the Vice President has not produced a single document sought by the Committees and has not indicated any intent to do so going forward.220  Witnesses who testified before the Committees have identified multiple additional documents that the Vice President is withholding that are directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry, including but not limited to:    notes taken by Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia, during the call between President Trump and President Zelensky on July 25;138    notes taken by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, National Security Advisor to the Vice President, during the call between President Trump and President Zelensky on July 25;139    materials that same day; 140    Zelensky on September 18;141 and    briefing materials prepared for Vice PresidSeptember 1 in Warsaw, Poland.142  The Committees also have good-faith reason to believe that the Office of the Vice President is in possession of and continues to withhold significantly more documents and records responsive to their request and of direct relevance to the impeachment inquiry.   Office of Management and Budget  On October 7, the Committees sent a letter to Russell Vought, Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), conveying a subpoena issued by the Intelligence Committee for nine categories of documents in response to public reports that the President directed OMB to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression.  The Committees wrote:  According to multiple press reports, at some point in July 2019, President Trump ordered Acting Chief of Staff and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney to freeze the military aid to Ukraine, and Mr. Mulvaney reportedly conveyed Department, which were told only that the administration was looking at whether the 143   The subpoena compelled Acting Director Vought to produce responsive documents by October 15.144  On that day, OMB Associate Director for Legislative Affairs Jason Yaworske responded by refusing to produce any documents and reciting many of the same baseless arguments as the White House Counsel:   that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in221  ion to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances.145   To date, Acting Director Vought has not produced a single document sought by the Committees and has not indicated any intent to do so going forward.    Witnesses who testified before the Committees have identified multiple additional documents that Acting Director Vought is withholding that are directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry, including but not limited to:    a June 19 email from OMB Associate Director of National Security Programs Michael 146     a July 12 email from White House Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the directing a hold on militarsecurity assistance package;147 and    attendance at a Principals Committee meeting on Ukrainian security assistance, which included a recommendation to lift the military assistance hold.148  The Committees also have good-faith reason to believe that the Office of Management and Budget is in possession of and continues to withhold significantly more documents and records responsive to the subpoena and of direct relevance to the impeachment inquiry.   Department of State  On September 9, the Committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting six categories of documents in response to reports that personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice 149  The Committees requested that Secretary Pompeo produce responsive documents by September 16.  The Secretary did not provide any documents or response by that date.  On September 23, the Committees sent a follow-up letter asking Secretary Pompeo to  close of business on Thursday, September 26, 2019, whether you 150  The Secretary did not provide any documents or respond by that date.222  On September 27, the Committees sent a letter to Secretary Pompeo conveying a subpoena for documents issued by Rep. Eliot Engel, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, compelling the production of documents by October 4.151    Since Secretary Pompeo had failed to respond, the Committees also sent separate letters to six individual State Department employees seeking documents in their possession and requesting that they participate in depositions with the Committees.152   On October 1, Secretary Pompeo responded to the Committees for the first time.  He objected to the Committees seeking documents directly from State Department employees after and an invitation to violate federal records laws153  154    To the contrary, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, one of the State Department 155  Rather, Mr. Kent said that the language in te Department attorney without 156  Mr. Kent explained that, when he raised this concern, saying, What you did in there, if Congress knew what you were doing, they could say that you 157  With respect to his own compliance with the subpoena for documents, Secretary Pompeo 158  Later on October 1, the Committees sent a letter to Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan in with President Zelensky on July 25.  The Committees wrote:  We are writing to you because Secretary Pompeo now appears to have an obvious conflict of interest.  He reportedly participated personally in the July 25, 2019 call, in which President Donald Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden immediately after the Ukrainian President raised his desire for United States military assistance to counter Russian aggression.  If true, Secretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the impeachment inquiry.  He should not be making any decisions regarding witness testimony or document production in order to protect himself or the President.  Any effort by the Secretary or the Department to intimidate or prevent witnesses from testifying or withhold documents from the Committees shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry.159223  The following day, at a press conference in Italy, Secretary Pompeo publicly acknowledged that he had been on the July 25 call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky.160   On October 7, Committee staff met with State Department officials who acknowledged that they had taken no steps to collect documents in response to the September 9 letter, but instead had waited for the September 27 subpoena before beginning to search for responsive records.  During that conversation, the Committees made a good-faith attempt to engage the Department in the constitutionally-mandated accommodations process.  The Committees especially those documents identified by the witnesses as responsiveThe depositions of these witnessesAmbassador Sondland, Ambassador Yovanovitch, and Mr. Kentwere scheduled for the days shortly after that representatives stated that they would take the request back to senior State Department officials, but never provided any further response.161   To date, Secretary Pompeo has not produced a single document sought by the Committees and has not indicated any intent to do so going forward.  In addition, the Department has ordered its employees not to produce documents in their personal possession.  For example, 162  Moreover, the Department appears to have actively discouraged its employees from  subpoena.  Mr. Kent testified in his deposition that he informed a Department attorney about additional responsive records that the Department had not collected, including an email from Assistant Secretary of State for Consular ad spoken to Rudy Giuliani several times in January about trying to 163  The clear th164  Mr. Kent 165  ced the substance of key documents.  For example, Ambassador Sondland attached ten exhibits to his written hearing statement.166  These exhibits contained replicas of emails and WhatsApp messages between Ambassador Sondland and high-level Trump Administration officials, including Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Perry, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton.167  The exhibits also contained a replica of a WhatsApp message between Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Yermak.168  Earlier in the investigation, Ambassador Kurt Volker had produced key text messages Yermak, Mr. Giuliani, and others very soon after the Committees requested them and prior to 169224  The Department also prevented Ambassador Sondlanda current State Department employeefrom accessing records to prepare for his testimony.  As described above, federal law under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of 170  impeded his testimony:  I have not had access to all of my phone records, State Department emails, and other State Department documents.  And I was told I could not work with my EU Staff to pull together the relevant files.  Having access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met, when, and   My lawyers and I have made multiple requests to the State Department and the White House for these materials.  Yet, these materials were not provided to me.  They have also refused to share these materials with this Committee.  These documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available.171    172  Ambassador Sondland also stated:  Despite repeated requests to the White House and the State Department, I have not been granted access to all of the phone records, and I would like to review those phone records, along with any notes and other documents that may exist, to determine if I can provide more complete testimony to assist Congress.173  On November 22, the Department produced 99 pages of emails, letters, notes, timelines, and news articles to a non-partisan, nonprofit ethics watchdog organization pursuant to a court order in a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).174  This handful of documents was limited to a narrow window of time and specific people, but it clearly indicates     For example, the Depar175  It also contains a March 27 email in which Madeleine Westerhout, the Personal Secretary to President Trump, facilitates another phone call between Rudy Giuliani and Secretary Pompeo.176  These documents are directly responsive to the September 27 subpoena ing or referring to:  Communications between any current or former State Department officials or employees and Rudolph W.

Department of Defense  On October 7, the Committees sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper conveying a subpoena issued by the Intelligence Committee for 14 categories of documents in response to reports that the President directed a freeze of hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid appropriated by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression.  The Committees wrote:   Officials at the and should not be 182226  The subpoena required Secretary Esper to produce responsive documents by October 15.

A:  Yeah we will do everything we can to cooperate with the Congress.  Just in the last week or two, my general counsel sent out a note as we typically do in these situations to ensure documents are retained. Q:  Is that a yes? A:    Q:  You will comply with the subpoena?  A:  We will do everything we can to comply.183  On October 15, however, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs Robert R.

Department of Energy  On October 10, the Committees sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Rick Perry conveying a subpoena issued by the Intelligence Committee for ten categories of documents in response to reports about his involvement with matters under investigation.  The Committees wrote:  Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to beneinterfere in our 2020 election.192   The subpoena required Secretary Perry to produce responsive documents by October 18.  On that day, Melissa F. Burnison, the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, responded by refusing to produce any documents and reciting many of the same flawed arguments as the White House Counsel:  your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be 193  To date, Secretary Perry has not produced a single document sought by the Committees and has not indicated any intent to do so going forward.

Overview  No other President in history has issued an order categorically directing the entire Executive Branch not to testify before Congress, including in the context of an impeachment inquiry.  President Trump issued just such an order.    As reflected in White House Counsel Pat Cipollondirected all government witnesses to violate their legal obligations by defying House subpoenasregardless of their office or position.208  President Trump even extended his order to former officials no longer employed by the federal government.  This Administration-wide effort to prevent all witnesses from providing testimony was coordinated and comprehensive.  may be used against y  evidence of his conduct from courageous individuals who were willing to follow the law, comply obstruct witness testimony deprived Congress and the public of additional evidence.   thorized Congressional subpoenas, several Administration officials who, to date, remain under subpoena may have placed themselves at risk of being held in criminal contempt of Congress.209  These witnesses were warned explicitly that their refusal to obey labeing drawn against both them and the President.210  Mick Mulvaney, Acting White House Chief of Staff   On November 5, the Committees sent a letter to Mick Mulvaney, the Acting White House Chief of Staff, seeking his appearance at a deposition on November 8.211  The Committees received no response to this letter.232  On November 7, the Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena compelling Mr. 212  attending the deposition today, and he is considering t213  scheduled deposition on November 8, 214  a letter sent on November 7 from Steven A.

Over the past several weeks, we have gathered pursue investigations that would benefit the President personally and politically and jeopardize national security in doing so.  Some of that evidence has revealed that Mr. Mulvaney was a percipient witness to misconduct by the President and may have had a role in certain actions under investigation.  The evidence shows that Mr. Mulvaney may have coordinated with U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, Rudy Bidens, Burisma holdings, and purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.  In addition, evidence suggests that Mr. Mulvaney may have played political investigations by withholding nearly $400 million in vital security assistance from Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress.  At a White House press briefing on October 17, 2019, Mr. Mulvaney admitted publicly that President Trump ordered the l political interests rather than the national interest.233  refusal to testify is intended to prevent the Committees from learning additional evidence  evidence to contest those facts, they would allow Mr. Mulvaney to be deposed.  Instead, the President and the White House are hiding and trying to conceal the truth from the American people.  Given the extensive evidence the Committees have already uncovered, the only result of this stonewalling is to buttress the case for obstruction of this inquiry.217  To date, Mr. Mulvaney has not changed his position about compliance with the subpoena.218  Robert B.

To date, Mr. Blair has not changed his position or contacted the Committees about compliance with the subpoena.234  Ambassador John Bolton, Former National Security Advisor  On October 30, the Committees sent a letter to the personal attorney of Ambassador John Bolton, the former National Security Advisor to President Trump, seeking his appearance at a deposition on November 7.223  Later 224    On November 7, Ambassador Bolton did not appear for the scheduled deposition.  On Counsel of the House of Representatives, suggesting that, if Ambassador Bolton were subpoenaed, he would file a lawsuit and would comply with the subpoena only if ordered to do so by the court.  He referenced a lawsuit filed by another former official, Dr. Charles Kupperman, represented by the same attorney and stated:  As I emphasized in my previous responses to letters from the House Chairs, Dr. Kupperman stands ready, as does Ambassador Bolton, to testify if the Judiciary resolves 225  To date, Ambassador Bolton has not changed his position or come forward to testify.226  John A. Eisenberg, Deputy Counsel to the President for  National Security Affairs and Legal Advisor, National Security Council  On October 30, the Committees sent a letter to John A. Eisenberg, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and the Legal Advisor at the National Security Council, seeking his appearance at a deposition on November 4.227  The Committees received no response to this letter.228  On November 1, the Committees sent a letter to Mr. Eisenberg transmitting a subpoena compelling his appearance at a deposition on November 4.229  personal attorney sent a letter to the Committees, stating:  Even if Mr. Eisenberg had been afforded a reasonable amount of time to prepare, the President has instructed Mr. Eisenberg not to appear at the deposition.

To the extent the White House believes that an issue could be raised at the deposition that may implicate a valid claim of privilege, the White House may seek to assert that privilege with the Committee in advance of the deposition.  To date, as has been the case in every other failure to appear today also flies in the face of historical precedent.  Even absent impeachment proceedings, congressional committees have deposed senior White House officials, including White House counsels and senior White House lawyers.233236  Michael Ellis, Senior Associate Counsel to the President and  Deputy Legal Advisor, National Security Council  On October 30, the Committees sent a letter to Michael Ellis, a Senior Associate Counsel to the President and the Deputy Legal Advisor at the National Security Council, seeking his appearance at a deposition on November 4.234  an email to Committee staff stating:  [W]e are in receipt of an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel providing guidance on the validity of a subpoena under the current terms and conditions and based on that guidance we are not in a position to appear for a deposition at this time.235  This email followed the November 1 Office of Legal Counsel opinion, discussed above, Congressional subpoenas and provided justification for noncompliance by officials who could not plausibly be   stating:  [O]ur guidance is that the failure to permit agency counsel to attend a deposition of Mr. Ellis would not allow sufficient protection of relevant privileges and therefore render any subpoena constitutionally invalid.

It is noteworthy and telling that OLC issued this opinion after multiple current and former White House, State Department, and Department of Defense officials testified before the committees, both voluntarily and pursuant to subpoena, all without agency counsel present.  The White -serving OLC opinion should therefore be seen for what it is:  a desperate attempt to staunch the flow of incriminating testimony from the executive 242  To date, Mr. Griffith has not changed his position or contacted the Committees about compliance with the subpoena.  Dr. Charles M. Kupperman, Former Deputy Assistant to the President  for National Security Affairs, National Security Council  On October 16, the Committees sent a letter to Dr. Charles M.

It will not be possible to accomplish those tasks before October 8, 2019.  Thus, as I am sure that you can understand, Mr. Brechbuhl will not be able to appear on that date as he requires a sufficient opportunity to consult October 1, 2019, to Chairman Engel, any participation in a deposition would need to be coordinated with our stakeholders.276  October 17.  277  On October 9, 278  Later that day, Mr. 279  transm6.280  stating:  Mr. Brechbuhl respects the important Constitutional powers vested in the United States Congress.

However, Mr. Brechbuhl has received a letter of instruction from the State Department, directing that he not appear.  The State Department letter of instruction asserts significant Executive Branch interests as the basis for direction not to appear and also asserts that the subpoena Mr. Brechbuhl received is invalid.

And so in your long and distinguished career you have done another great public service in answering the call of our subpoena and testifying before us today.298   Ambassador Gordon Sondland, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, Department of State  On September 27, 2019, the Committees sent a letter informing Secretary Pompeo that 299  That same day, the Committees sent a letter directly to Ambassador Sondland seeking his appearance at the deposition.300  On October 1, Secretary Pompeo sent a letter to the Committees stating that 301  was rescheduled for October 8.

President Trump publicly attacked and intimidated witnesses who came forward to comply with duly authorized subpoenas and testify about his conduct.  The President also threatened and attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower.   Overview  President Trump engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate witnesses who came forward to comply with duly authorized subpoenas and testify about his conduct, raising grave concerns about potential violations of the federal obstruction statute and other criminal laws intended to protect witnesses appearing before Congressional proceedings.  President Trump issued threats, openly discussed possible retaliation, made insinuations about friends, and coworkersand his actions drew criticism from across the political spectrum, including from his own Republican supporters.    It is a federal crime to intimidate or seek to intimidate any witness appearing before Congress.  This statute applies to all citizens, including federal officials.  Violations of this law can carry a criminal sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  This campaign of intimidation risks discouraging witnesses from coming forward voluntarily, complying with mandatory subpoenas for documents and testimony, and disclosing evidence that may support consideration of articles of impeachment.  Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Department of State  As discussed above, President Trump removed Marie Yovanovitch as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in May 2019 following a concerted effort by Rudy Giuliani, his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, and others to spread false conspiracy theories about her.  The smearing of the Ambassador was part of the larger campaign undertaken by Mr. Giuliani at deposition on October 11, Ambassador Yovanovitch explained that s401    On November 15, Ambassador Yovanovitch testified at a public hearing that she was   I was shocked and devastated that I would feature in a phone call between two heads of state in such a manner, where President Trump said that I was bad news to another world258  it wasit was a terrible moment.  A person who saw me actually reading the transcript said that the color drained from my face.  I think I even had a physical reaction.  I think, you know, even now, words kind of fail me.402  didn403  As Ambassador Yovanovitch was in the process of testifying before the Committee, President Trump tweeted an attack against her.  He wrote:  Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad.  She started off in Somalia, how did that go?  Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke right to appoint ambassadors.404  During the hearing, Chairman Schiff asked Ambassador Yovanovitch for her reaction to   Q: notwithstanding the fact you were urged by the White House or State Department not to; notwithstanding the fact that, as you testified earlier, the President implicitly threatened you in that call record.  And now, the President in real-time willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing? A:    Q:  A:   IIeffect is to be intimidating. Q: Well, I want to let you know, Ambassador, that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.405   406  Rep. Francis Rooney, also a Republican, stated:  servi407    Even after these rebukes, the President continued to attack and threaten Ambassador Yovanovitch.  For example, in an interview on November 22, President Trump stated:  not an angel, this woman, okay?  And there are a lot of things that s  And 408259  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander S. Vindman, Director for Ukraine, National Security Council  409  When asked by a reporter what evidence he had for his claim, the President 410  President Trump continued attacking Lt. Col. Vindman during his testimony on November 19, seeking to question his 411  Allies of the 412  For his part, Lt. Col. Vindman stated during his testimony:    I want to take a moment to recognize the courage of my colleagues who have appeared and are scheduled to appear before this Committee.  I want to state that the vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible.413   U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Department of State  414  An hour later, he 415    Secr  Q: Do you want him out now as the top diplomat? A:  416  On the morning of November 13, just before Ambassador Taylor and George Kent 417   Jennifer Williams, Special Advisor for Europe and Russia, Office of the Vice President   On November 17, two days before Jennifer Williams testified at a public hearing, other 418  During the hearing, Rep. Jim Himes asked Ms. Williams what prised me.  I260  too, and it looks an awful lot like witness intimidation and tampering, and an effort to try to get 419     Threats of Retaliation  The President suggested that witnesses who testified as part of the impeachment inquiry could face retaliation.  For example, on November 16, the President sent a pair of tweets indicating that three witnesses appearing before the impeachment inquiry could face dismissals as a result of their testimony.  The President tweeted language he attributed to radio host Rush Limbaugh:  paramountly obvious watching this, these people have to go.  You elected Donald Trump to drain the Swamp, well, dismissing people like Yovanovitch is what that looks like. Obama holdover days trying to undermine Trump, getting rid of those people, dismissing them, this is what it looks like.  It was never going to be clean, they were never going to 420  Intelligence Community Whistleblower  In addition to his relentless attacks on witnesses who testified in connection with the of the Intelligence Community who filed an anonymous whistleblower complaint raising an confidentially with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, as authorized by the relevant whistleblower law.  Federal law prohibits the Inspector General from revealing the 421  Federal law also protects the whistleblower from retaliation.422   On September 9, the Inspector General notified Congress that this individual had filed a  the Acting Director of National Intelligence was withholding the complaint from Congresscontrary to his statutory obligation to have submitted the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees by no later than September 2.423  On September 13, 2019, the Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to the 424   On September 26, the Intelligence Committee received the declassified whistleblower complaint and made it available to the public.425    That day, the President issued a chilling threat against the whistleblower and those who they could face the death penalty for treason.  President Trump stated:   -blower the information because with spies and treason, right?  We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.426261   In response, the Committees warned President Trump to stop attacking the whistleblower, stating:   reprehensible witness intimidation and an  We attacks, and we invite our Republican counterparts to do the same because Congress must do all it can to protect this whistleblower, and all whistleblowers.  Threats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security.427  d the accuracy of the 100 public statements about the whistleblower over a period of just two months.  For example, the President stated:   INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which 428   429  Susan Rice, which means Obama.

And the whistleblower is a political o434  In response to a request from Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes to call the whistleblower to testify at an open hearing, Chairman Schiff underscored the danger testimony was now unnecessary:   The Committee also will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm.  It remains the duty of the Intelligence Committee to protect whistleblowers, and until recently, this was a bipartisan priority.  The262  whistleblower has a right under laws championed by this Committee to remain anonymous and to be protected from harm.   The impeachment inquiry, moreover, has gathered an ever-growing body of evidencerecordthat not only confirms, but far exceeds, the initial information in the s complaint.

Nunes, serving in 2017 as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, spoke in defense of whiswe will protect the identity of those people at all cost.437  He also stated:  at we have continued to have people come forward, voluntarily, to this committee and we want to continue that and I will tell you that that will not happen if we tell you who our sources are and people that comecome to the committee. 438   Other Republican Members of Congress have opposed efforts to expose the whistleblower.  For example, Senator Charles Grassley stated:  This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected.  We should alwapublic interesteven if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks.439  Senator Richard Burr, the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, affirmed 440  Senator Mitt Romney also called for support of the whistle441263  SECTION II ENDNOTES1 U.S. Const.

McGahnpoint as plain as possible, it is clear to this Court for the reasons explained above that, with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist.  Indeed, absolute testimonial immunity for senior-level White House aides appears to be a fiction that has been fastidiously maintained over time through the force of sheer repetition in OLC opinions, and through accommodations that have permitted its proponents to avoid having the proposition tested in the crucible of litigation.  And because the basis in the law, it does not matter whether such immunity would theoretically be available to only a handful of presidential aides due to the sensitivity of their positions, or to the entire Executive branch.  Nor does it make any difference whether the aides in quAs of this report, an appeal is pending in the D.C. Circuit. No. 19-5331 (D.C. Cir.).   255 See, Kupperman v. U.S. House of Representatives, et al., No. 19 Civ. 3224 (D.D.C.).
