This was good-the pork was flavored well, pulled apart easily, and not over done. It had a strong orange flavor, so if you don't want that as pronounced I would only use half an orange. I did not mix the spices at all, but dumped all ingredients into the pot as per directions, and it was fine. There was a lot of cooking liquid at the end, so after removing the pork and other solid ingredients I turned the "Saute" feature on medium and reduced the sauce with the lid off--it took about 15 minutes more, but worked like a charm. You could probably add the pork after the sauce was reduced and saute it all together to get a little crisp-ness on the meat, too.
