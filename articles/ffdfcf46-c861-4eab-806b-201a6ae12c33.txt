Looking back, my first mistake in this endeavor was, as usual, overthinking things. The best — and most popular — recipe I’ve ever written has three ingredients: buttermilk, chicken and salt. It’s simple, easy and extraordinarily tasty. Anyone with an oven can make it. It’s my favorite roast chicken, and it just so happens that buttermilk plays the role of three separate elements — a sugar, an acid and a liquid brine. The lactose in buttermilk produces the chicken’s signature mahogany-brown skin while the acids help tenderize the meat and offer a slight, pleasant tang. And some of the water the buttermilk contains makes its way into the chicken during the overnight marination, yielding moist meat.

After deconstructing that recipe and examining what made it so wonderful, I wanted to put it back together in an even more appealing way. And what’s more appealing than a bread stuffing? Nothing, if you ask me. In keeping with the second cardinal rule of virality, I wanted to create a one-pan dinner. I like my stuffing to be absurdly moist; if I cooked the chicken atop the bread, it would absorb any drippings. If I brined the chicken in chicken stock, then the drippings would be doubly chickeny. There was my hook! Who’d ever heard of stock-brined chicken? And, as a bonus, I could dilute the brine with a little more unsalted stock and toss stale bread in the flavorful liquid so that nothing was wasted. At this point, I was feeling really proud of myself. Then I remembered that there isn’t anything sweet or acidic about chicken stock, which meant I would need to add more ingredients. I settled on apple cider and cider vinegar — both acidic and aligned with that slightly Thanskgiving-ish flavor I wanted for the stuffing.
