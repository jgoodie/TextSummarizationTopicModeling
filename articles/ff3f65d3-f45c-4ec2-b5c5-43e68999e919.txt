Flickr/Eduardo Fonseca Arraes I first wrote about the world's 25 least visited countries in 2013, and the post has has been read almost a million times, in addition to have been translated to several languages, republished in many countries, rewritten and plagiarized.

Two years have passed, and it is time for an update of what I consider the ultimate traveler's bucket list.

Why countries are less visited varies, but location, travel related logistics, costs, visa availability, governments or lack thereof and degree of war usually matters.

Figures on international visitors are often sparse for the least visited countries, quite a few of them lack tourism offices or governmental agencies that usually report such numbers.

UNWTO, World Tourism Organization and the UN, have rather comprehensive overviews, but several countries have not contributed with official numbers. I have therefore, as in 2013, had to look elsewhere. I have used news reports, passenger numbers from airports and spoken to tourist agencies.

Tourist numbers can in any case never be totally accurate as various countries count tourists differently. Some do for instance count tourists arriving by plane, others track those that stay in hotels. And there are always some people that claim to be tourists, simply to avoid the extra bureaucracy that may come with travelling on business.



In 2013, country number 25 was Dominica with 73,000 tourists. And do you know what? Dominica is still number 25, sort of. Two countries are tied for number 25 this time around, with 78,000 tourists each. That means that you will get 26 countries for the price of 25.

What a bonus.

78,000 might sound like a lot, but it is only just over 200 visitors a day. In an entire country. Not really anything to bet your economy on. You may also be surprised to learn that North Korea is no longer among the 25 countries, with approximately 270,000 international tourists a year (most of them are Chinese).
