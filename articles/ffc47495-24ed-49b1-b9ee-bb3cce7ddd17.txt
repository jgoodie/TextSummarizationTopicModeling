“The biggest factor was the tax cuts, which gave a short-term sugar high but now are just contributing to a larger deficit,” said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, which promotes fiscal responsibility. “We don’t have an economy that’s going to grow its way out of this problem.”

The deficit, which is the gap between what the government takes in through taxes and other sources of revenue and what it spends, now sits at 4.6 percent of gross domestic product, up from 3.8 percent of G.D.P. in 2018. Tax revenue accounts for just 16.3 percent of the total economy.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Friday that the president’s economic agenda was working, pointing to the historically low jobless rate, and called on lawmakers to help the administration cut spending.

“In order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals — like the president’s 2020 budget plan — to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

Fears of trillion-dollar deficits could renew the desire of Republicans in Congress to propose cuts to social programs, like food stamps, Social Security and other safety net benefits. Republicans have long pointed to swelling deficits as a reason to pursue their long-held vision of smaller government, including undoing many of the programs ushered in during the New Deal and Great Society to help the most disadvantaged Americans.

But Republican lawmakers were largely mum on Friday and some of the most vocal fiscal hawks have left Congress. Senator Mike Enzi, a retiring Republican from Wyoming who leads the budget committee, called the country’s fiscal path unsustainable and said spending must come down.

“While the federal government’s revenue continues to grow, spending is growing twice as fast,” Mr. Enzi said in a statement. “We simply cannot afford to continue ignoring the fiscal challenges our nation faces.”
